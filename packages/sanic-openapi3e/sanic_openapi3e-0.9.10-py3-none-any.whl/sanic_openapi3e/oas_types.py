"""
OpenAPI Spec 3.0.2 types, though without any `Specification Extensions
<https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md#specificationExtensions>`_

Some terms in the spec are unsuitable for python, they have been changed in the code:

* `in` -> `_in`
* `type` -> `_type`
* `format` -> `_format`
* `$ref` -> `_ref`
* `license` -> `_license`

Given that these changes were already needed, some others were also added to keep with PEP8 naming conventions in this
code:

* `operationId` -> `operation_id`
*

In (many) other examples, terms using camelCase were changed to use underscores. Eg `readOnly` -> `read_only`.

Limitations
-----------
This implementation has some known limitations:

* Phrases in the spec like "MUST be in the format of a URL.", or "MUST be in the format of an email address." are noted,
  in the docs, but not checked.
* There is no accommodation for Specification Extensions.
* Schema.items is not well understood, your mileage may vary.
* SecurityScheme (specifically the REQUIREDs) are not well understood, and so no validation checks on REQUIRED fields
  are done.

            interface.  A title will preferrably [sic] be short.
        :param multiple_of: The value of "multiple_of" MUST be a number, strictly greater than 0. A numeric instance is
            only valid if division by this keyword's value results in an integer.
        :param maximum: The value of "maximum" MUST be a number, representing an upper limit for a numeric instance. If
            the instance is a number, then this keyword validates if "exclusiveMaximum" is true and instance is less
            than the provided value, or else if the instance is less than or exactly equal to the provided value.
        :param exclusive_maximum: The value of "exclusive_maximum" MUST be a boolean, representing whether the limit in
            "maximum" is exclusive or not.  An undefined value is the same as false. If "exclusive_maximum" is true,
            then a numeric instance SHOULD NOT be equal to the value specified in "maximum". If "exclusive_maximum" is
            false (or not specified), then a numeric instance MAY be equal to the value of "maximum".
        :param minimum: The value of "minimum" MUST be a number, representing a lower limit for a numeric instance. If
            the instance is a number, then this keyword validates if "exclusive_minimum" is true and instance is greater
            than the provided value, or else if the instance is greater than or exactly equal to the provided value.
        :param exclusive_minimum: The value of "exclusive_minimum" MUST be a boolean, representing whether the limit in
            "minimum" is exclusive or not.  An undefined value is the same as false. If "exclusive_minimum" is true,
            then a numeric instance SHOULD NOT be equal to the value specified in "minimum". If "exclusive_minimum" is
            false (or not specified), then a numeric instance MAY be equal to the value of "minimum".
        :param max_length: The value of this keyword MUST be a non-negative integer. The value of this keyword MUST be
            an integer.  This integer MUST be greater than, or equal to, 0. A string instance is valid against this
            keyword if its length is less than, or equal to, the value of this keyword. The length of a string instance
            is defined as the number of its characters as defined by RFC 7159 [RFC7159].
        :param min_length: A string instance is valid against this keyword if its length is greater than, or equal to,
            the value of this keyword. The length of a string instance is defined as the number of its characters as
            defined by RFC 7159 [RFC7159]. The value of this keyword MUST be an integer.  This integer MUST be greater
            than, or equal to, 0. "min_length", if absent, may be considered as being present with integer value 0.
        :param pattern: The value of this keyword MUST be a string.  This string SHOULD be a valid regular expression,
            according to the ECMA 262 regular expression dialect. A string instance is considered valid if the regular
            expression matches the instance successfully.  Recall: regular expressions are not implicitly anchored.
            Note: whether or not this is a valid regular expression is not checked by sanic-openapi3e.
        :param max_items: The value of this keyword MUST be an integer.  This integer MUST be greater than, or equal to,
            0. An array instance is valid against "maxItems" if its size is less than, or equal to, the value of this
            keyword.
        :param min_items: The value of this keyword MUST be an integer.  This integer MUST be greater than, or equal to,
            0. An array instance is valid against "minItems" if its size is greater than, or equal to, the value of this
            keyword. If this keyword is not present, it may be considered present with a value of 0.
        :param unique_items: The value of this keyword MUST be a boolean. If this keyword has boolean value false, the
            instance validates successfully.  If it has boolean value true, the instance validates successfully if all
            of its elements are unique. If not present, this keyword may be considered present with boolean value false.
        :param max_properties: he value of this keyword MUST be an integer.  This integer MUST be greater than, or equal
            to, 0. An object instance is valid against "max_properties" if its number of properties is less than, or
            equal to, the value of this keyword.
        :param min_properties: The value of this keyword MUST be an integer.  This integer MUST be greater than, or
            equal to, 0. An object instance is valid against "min_properties" if its number of properties is greater
            than, or equal to, the value of this keyword. If this keyword is not present, it may be considered present
            with a value of 0.
        :param required: The value of this keyword MUST be an array.  This array MUST have at least one element.
            Elements of this array MUST be strings, and MUST be unique. An object instance is valid against this keyword
            if its property set contains all elements in this keyword's array value. Note: sanic-openapi3e implements
            these checks as a Set of str.
        :param enum: The value of this keyword MUST be an array.  This array SHOULD have at least one element.
            Elements in the array SHOULD be unique. Elements in the array MAY be of any type, including null. An
            instance validates successfully against this keyword if its value is equal to one of the elements in this
            keyword's array value. Note: sanic-openapi3e implements these checks as a Set of Any.
        :param _type: Value MUST be a string. Multiple types via an array are not supported.
        :param all_of: Inline or referenced schema MUST be of a Schema Object and not a standard JSON Schema.
        :param one_of: Inline or referenced schema MUST be of a Schema Object and not a standard JSON Schema.
        :param any_of: Inline or referenced schema MUST be of a Schema Object and not a standard JSON Schema.
        :param _not: Inline or referenced schema MUST be of a Schema Object and not a standard JSON Schema.
        :param items: Value MUST be an object and not an array. Inline or referenced schema MUST be of a Schema Object
            and not a standard JSON Schema. items MUST be present if the type is array.
        :param properties: Property definitions MUST be a Schema Object and not a standard JSON Schema (inline or
            referenced).
        :param additional_properties: Value can be boolean or object. Inline or referenced schema MUST be of a Schema
            Object and not a standard JSON Schema. Consistent with JSON Schema, additionalProperties defaults to true.
        :param description: CommonMark syntax MAY be used for rich text representation.
        :param _format:  See `Data Type Formats
            <https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md#dataTypeFormat>`_ for further
            details. While relying on JSON Schema's defined formats, the OAS offers a few additional predefined formats.
        :param default: The default value represents what would be assumed by the consumer of the input as the value of
            the schema if one is not provided. Unlike JSON Schema, the value MUST conform to the defined type for the
            Schema Object defined at the same level. For example, if type is string, then default can be "foo" but
            cannot be 1.
        :param nullable: Allows sending a null value for the defined schema. Default value is false.
        :param discriminator: Adds support for polymorphism. The discriminator is an object name that is used to
            differentiate between other schemas which may satisfy the payload description. See Composition and
            Inheritance for more details.
        :param read_only: Relevant only for Schema "properties" definitions. Declares the property as "read only". This
            means that it MAY be sent as part of a response but SHOULD NOT be sent as part of the request. If the
            property is marked as read_only being true and is in the required list, the required will take effect on the
            response only. A property MUST NOT be marked as both read_only and writeOnly being true. Default value is
            false.
        :param write_only: Relevant only for Schema "properties" definitions. Declares the property as "write only".
            Therefore, it MAY be sent as part of a request but SHOULD NOT be sent as part of the response. If the
            property is marked as write_only being true and is in the required list, the required will take effect on
            the request only. A property MUST NOT be marked as both read_only and write_only being true. Default value
            is false.
        :param xml: This MAY be used only on properties schemas. It has no effect on root schemas. Adds additional
            metadata to describe the XML representation of this property.
        :param external_docs: Additional external documentation for this schema.
        :param example: A free-form property to include an example of an instance for this schema. To represent examples
            that cannot be naturally represented in JSON or YAML, a string value can be used to contain the example with
            escaping where necessary.

        - path - Used together with Path Templating, where the parameter value is actually part of the operation's URL.
                 This does not include the host or base path of the API. For example, in /items/{itemId}, the path
                 parameter is itemId.
        - query - Parameters that are appended to the URL. For example, in /items?id=###, the query parameter is id.
        - header - Custom headers that are expected as part of the request. Note that RFC7230 states header names are
                   case insensitive.
        - cookie - Used to pass a specific cookie value to the API.

        :param name: REQUIRED. The name of the parameter. Parameter names are case sensitive. If in is "path", the name
            field MUST correspond to the associated path segment from the path field in the Paths Object. See Path
            Templating for further information. If in is "header" and the name field is "Accept", "Content-Type" or
            "Authorization", the parameter definition SHALL be ignored. For all other cases, the name corresponds to the
            parameter name used by the in property.

        :param _in: REQUIRED. The location of the parameter. Possible values are "query", "header", "path" or
            "cookie".
        :param description: A brief description of the parameter. This could contain examples of use. CommonMark syntax
            MAY be used for rich text representation.
        :param required: Determines whether this parameter is mandatory. If the parameter location is "path", this
            property is REQUIRED and its value MUST be true. Otherwise, the property MAY be included and its default
            value is false.
        :param deprecated: Specifies that a parameter is deprecated and SHOULD be transitioned out of usage. Default
            value is false.
        :param allow_empty_value: Sets the ability to pass empty-valued parameters. This is valid only for query
            parameters and allows sending a parameter with an empty value. Default value is false. If style is used, and
            if behavior is n/a (cannot be serialized), the value of allowEmptyValue SHALL be ignored. Use of this
            property is NOT RECOMMENDED, as it is likely to be removed in a later revision.
        :param style: Describes how the parameter value will be serialized depending on the type of the parameter value.
            Default values (based on value of ``location``):

            * for query - form;
            * for path - simple;
            * for header - simple;
            * for cookie - form.

        :param explode: When this is true, parameter values of type array or object generate separate parameters for
            each value of the array or key-value pair of the map. For other types of parameters this property has no
            effect. When style is form, the default value is true. For all other styles, the default value is false.
        :param allow_reserved: Determines whether the parameter value SHOULD allow reserved characters, as defined by
            RFC3986 ``:/?#[]@!$&'()*+,;=`` to be included without percent-encoding. This property only applies to
            parameters with an in value of query. The default value is false.
        :param schema: The schema defining the type used for the parameter.
        :param example: Example of the media type. The example SHOULD match the specified schema and encoding
            properties if present. The example field is mutually exclusive of the examples field. Furthermore, if
            referencing a schema which contains an example, the example value SHALL override the example provided by the
            schema. To represent examples of media types that cannot naturally be represented in JSON or YAML, a string
            value can contain the example with escaping where necessary.
        :param examples: Examples of the media type. Each example SHOULD contain a value in the correct format as
            specified in the parameter encoding. The examples field is mutually exclusive of the example field.
            Furthermore, if referencing a schema which contains an example, the examples value SHALL override the
            example provided by the schema.
        :param content: A map containing the representations for the parameter. The key is the media type and the value
            describes it. The map MUST only contain one entry.
