# CONTRIBUTING

Feel free to contribute. I have made some development related instructions below. This package was created using [dash-component-boilerplate](https://github.com/plotly/dash-component-boilerplate) and contains some automatically generated files, too.

## How to improve this package?

Maybe you already have an idea. If not, there is also a list for development ideas in the [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md).
## For developers
### Setting up development environment
- Clone this repository. Change current directory to project root.
- Install [npm and Node.js](https://nodejs.org) for building JS.
- Install the JS dependencies by running `npm install` on the project root. This will create `node_modules` directory.
- Create python virtual environment and activate it
- `pip install` this package in editable state with the `[dev]` flag.
```
python -m pip install -e <path_to_this_folder>[dev]
```

### Running demo page
1. Run `python usage.py`
2. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8050/ in your web browser

```
### Developing
**What files should I edit?**<br>

- React code: The react.js files in `src/lib/components/`<br>
- Python code: The non-auto-generated files in `dash_uploader` 


### Building: React.js -> JS & Python
Run in the project root
```
npm run build
```
This will create all the auto-generated (JS, json, python) files into the `dash_uploader/_build` folder.

### Testing built React with python

```
python usage.py
```


### Testing React components without python
- Before creating the "python/Dash" versions, it is possible to test the component(s) by
- Editing the content of `src/demo/index.js`, if you wish.
- Then, running
```
npm start
```
- Then, go to url `http://127.0.0.1:55555`. 
- The url can be changed in the package.json -> scripts -> start, by changing the `host` argument to the [`webpack-serve`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-serve).
- **Note**: There is not handler for POST requests in the demo! (the Upload component will not work without a POST handler)

### Creating new version to pip
- Update version in `package.json`
- Create new `dash_uploader-x.x.x.tar.gz` with 
```
python .\setup.py sdist
```
- Upload to pip with
```
twine upload .\dist\dash_uploader-x.x.x.tar.gz
```
