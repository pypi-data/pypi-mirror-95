## PushRadar Python Server Library

[PushRadar](https://pushradar.com) is a realtime API service for the web. The service uses a simple publish-subscribe model, allowing you to broadcast "messages" on "channels" that are subscribed to by one or more clients. Messages are pushed in realtime to those clients.

This is PushRadar's official Python server library.

## Prerequisites

In order to use this library, please ensure that you have the following:

- Python 3.3+
- A PushRadar account - you can sign up at [pushradar.com](https://pushradar.com)

## Installation

The easiest way to get up and running is to install the library using Pip or Pipenv. Run the following command in your console:

```bash
$ pip install pushradar
```

or

```bash
$ pipenv install pushradar
```

## Broadcasting Messages

```python
import pushradar

radar = pushradar.PushRadar('your-secret-key')
radar.broadcast('channel-1', {'message': 'Hello world!'})
```

## Receiving Messages

```html
<script src="https://pushradar.com/js/v3/pushradar.min.js"></script>
<script>
    var radar = new PushRadar('your-public-key');
    radar.subscribe.to('channel-1', function (data) {
        console.log(data.message);
    });
</script>
```

## Private Channels

Private channels require authentication and start with the prefix **private-**. We recommend that you use private channels by default to prevent unauthorised access to channels.

You will need to set up an authentication endpoint that returns a token using the `auth(...)` method if the user is allowed to subscribe to the channel. For example:

```python
radar = pushradar.PushRadar('your-secret-key')
if request.method == 'GET':
    channel_name = request.GET.get('channelName')
    socket_id = request.GET.get('socketID')
    # is user allowed to access channel?
    if True:
        return json.dumps({"token": radar.auth(channel_name, socket_id)})
```

Then register your authentication endpoint by calling the `auth(...)` method client-side:

```javascript
radar.auth('/auth');
```
