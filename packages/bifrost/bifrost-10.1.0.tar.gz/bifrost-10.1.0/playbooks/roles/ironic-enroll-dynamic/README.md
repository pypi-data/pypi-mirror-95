ironic-enroll-dynamic
=====================

Enrolls nodes into Ironic utilizing the os_ironic Ansible module that is
installed by Bifrost.

Requirements
------------

This role is dependent upon the os-ironic ansible module, which is dependent
upon openstacksdk (https://opendev.org/openstack/openstacksdk/).

Role Variables
--------------

ironic_url: The setting defining the URL to the Ironic API.  Presently
            defaulted to: "http://localhost:6385/"

ipa_kernel: The kernel url, image id, or file representing the kernel to
            utilize for deploying to this node. This should be the kernel
            used for the Ironic Python Agent.

ipa_ramdisk: The ramdisk url, image id, or file representing the ramdisk
             image to utilize to deploy this node. This should be the ramdisk
             used for the Ironic Python Agent.

ipa_file_protocol: The protocol to utilize to access IPA files. The default is
                   to utilize HTTP in generated HTTP URLs for bifrost, however
                   this setting allows a user to change that default if they
                   they have a modified local webserver configuration.
                   Do note, that a user wishing to utilize HTTPS may wish to
                   review the iPXE documentation: https://ipxe.org/crypto

noauth_mode: Controls if the module is called in noauth mode.
             By default, this is the standard mode of operation,
             however if set to false, the role utilizes os_client_config
             which expects a clouds.yml file.  More information about
             this file format can be found at:
             https://docs.openstack.org/os-client-config/latest/

cloud_name: Optional: String value defining a clouds.yaml entry for
            the ansible module to leverage.

This role expects a data structure similar to the one below, however it should
be understood that the individual entries under power can vary based on power
driver required.

{
  "node1": {
    "uuid": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "driver_info": {
      "power": {
        "ipmi_target_channel": "0",
        "ipmi_username": "ADMIN",
        "ipmi_address": "192.168.122.1",
        "ipmi_target_address": "0",
        "ipmi_password": "undefined",
        "ipmi_bridging": "single"
      }
    },
    "nics": [
      {
        "mac": "00:01:02:03:04:05"
      }.
   ],
   "driver": "ipmi",
   "ip_address": "192.168.122.2",
   "properties": {
      "cpu_arch": "x86_64",
      "ram": "3072",
      "disk_size": "10",
      "cpus": "1"
    },
    "name": "node1"
  }
}

Dependencies
------------

This role is presently dependent upon the bifrost-ironic-install role which
installs the necessary requirements.
