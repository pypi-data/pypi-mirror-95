Description: Bifrost
        -------
        
        Bifrost (pronounced bye-frost) is a set of Ansible playbooks that
        automates the task of deploying a base image onto a set of known hardware using
        ironic. It provides modular utility for one-off operating system deployment
        with as few operational requirements as reasonably possible.

        Use Cases
        ~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Installation of ironic in standalone/noauth mode without other OpenStack
          components.
        * Deployment of an operating system to a known pool of hardware as
          a batch operation.
        * Testing and development of ironic in a standalone use case.
