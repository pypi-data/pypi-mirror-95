    The default operating mode of bifrost now no longer powers off nodes
    once they have been inspected. This leaves the ironic-python-agent
    running and ultimately allows moving into deployment skipping a full
    boot sequence when following the typical use path.

    This setting may be disabled and the previous behavior reverted by
    changing the ``power_off_after_inspection`` setting to ``true``.
    This setting maps to ironic-inspector.conf's ``[processing]power_off``
    and ironic.conf's ``[inspector]power_off`` settings.
