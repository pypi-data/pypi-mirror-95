    The default libvirt network interface card type has been changed from
    ``virtio`` to ``e1000`` in order to support testing on Bionic. Users should
    not experience any issues as a result of this, however the
    ``bifrost-create-vm-nodes`` setting ``test_vm_nic`` can be used to explicitly
    choose ``virtio`` network interface cards.
