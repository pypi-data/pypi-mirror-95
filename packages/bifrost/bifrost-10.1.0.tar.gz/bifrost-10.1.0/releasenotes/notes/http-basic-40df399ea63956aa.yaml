features:
  - |
    HTTP basic authentication for API services is now supported in addition
    to no authentication and Keystone. It is triggered by setting
    ``noauth_mode=false`` with ``enable_keystone=false``.
  - |
    Installations with ``bifrost-cli`` now use HTTP basic authentication if
    Keystone is disabled.
deprecations:
  - |
    Bifrost will switch to HTTP basic authentication by default in the future.
    If you want to avoid it, please set ``noauth_mode`` to ``false``
    explicitly.
