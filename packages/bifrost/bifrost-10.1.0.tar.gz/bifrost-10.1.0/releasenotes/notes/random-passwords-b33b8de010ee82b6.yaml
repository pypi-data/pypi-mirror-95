upgrade:
  - |
    The ``inspector_user`` user is not created by default any more. Use
    ``bifrost_user`` instead.
  - |
    If you're relying on default passwords (e.g. for the database or keystone
    passwords), they will be changed on upgrade. Please use explicit values
    if you want to avoid it.
security:
  - |
    Random passwords are now generated by default instead of using a constant.
    The same parameters as before can be used to override them.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``ironic_db_password`` parameter is deprecated, please use
    ``service_password`` to set a password to use between services or
    override the whole ``ironic`` and ``keystone`` objects.
