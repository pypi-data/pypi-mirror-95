fixes:
  - |
    Instead of modifying the ``public`` firewalld zone, creates a new zone
    ``bifrost`` and puts the ``network_interface`` in it. Set
    ``firewalld_internal_zone=public`` to revert to the previous behavior.
upgrade:
  - |
    Bifrost no longer adds ironic and ironic-inspector endpoints to the public
    firewalld zone, the operator has to do it explicitly if external access
    is expected.
