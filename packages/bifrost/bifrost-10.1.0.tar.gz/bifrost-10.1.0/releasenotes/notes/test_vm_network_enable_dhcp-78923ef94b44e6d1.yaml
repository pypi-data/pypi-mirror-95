fixes:
  - |
    Removes the ``test_vm_network_enable_dhcp`` option and disables DHCP on
    the libvirt network instead of unconditionally killing all dnsmasq
    processes on the machine.
upgrade:
  - |
    Bifrost will no longer kill all running dnsmasq processes for you. If you
    have dnsmasq processes that are not managed by systemd, you have to stop
    them yourself.
