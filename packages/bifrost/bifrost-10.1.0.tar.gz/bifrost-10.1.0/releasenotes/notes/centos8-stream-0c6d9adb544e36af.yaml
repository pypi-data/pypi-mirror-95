    Following an `announcement
    <https://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos-announce/2020-December/048208.html>`_
    by the CentOS project, Bifrost has switched to CentOS Stream for testing.
    Regular CentOS is no longer tested in the CI, meaning that both it and
    RHEL will only be tested indirectly and supported on the best effort basis.
