    When using Keystone, no longer locks users out of their accounts on 3
    unsuccessful attempts to log in. This creates a very trivially exploitable
    denial-of-service issue. Use ``keystone_lockout_security_attempts``
    to re-enable (not recommended).
features:
  - |
    If ``keystone_lockout_security_attempts`` is enabled, the amount of time
    the account stays locked is now regulated by the new parameter
    ``keystone_lockout_duration`` (defaulting to 1800 seconds).
