features:
  - |
    Supports TLS configuration by setting ``enable_tls=true`` and, optionally,
    ``generate_tls=true``. The corresponding ``bifrost-cli`` argument is
    ``--enable-tls`` (auto-generated certificates only).
issues:
  - |
    When using Keystone for authentication, it may not be possible to disable
    TLS after enabling it if the certificate is in a non-standard location.
  - |
    Due to upgrade limitations, it may not be possible to enable TLS on
    upgrading from a previous version. Do an upgrade first, then enable TLS
    in a separate installation step.
