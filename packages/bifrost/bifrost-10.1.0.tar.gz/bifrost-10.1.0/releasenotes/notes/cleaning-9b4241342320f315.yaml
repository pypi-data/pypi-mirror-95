features:
  - |
    Metadata cleaning is now enabled by default, set ``cleaning`` to ``false``
    to disable completely.
  - |
    To enable full disk cleaning, set ``cleaning_disk_erase`` to ``true``.
upgrade:
  - |
    If you use ``cleaning=true`` to enable full disk cleaning, you need to
    also set ``cleaning_disk_erase=true`` now. Omitting it will result in
    only metadata cleaning enabled.
