features:
  - |
    Added creation of a symbolic link from $VENV/collections directory which
    contains ansible collections to the playbooks subdirectory of bifrost.
    This is done in the env-setup.sh script.
fixes:
  - |
    The addition of the symbolic link makes bifrost playbooks independent of
    the ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATHS environment variable which wasn't reliably
    set in some environments.
