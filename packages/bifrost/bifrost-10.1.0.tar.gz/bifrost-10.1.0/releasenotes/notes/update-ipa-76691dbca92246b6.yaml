    An ironic-python-agent image is now updated every time the installation
    playbooks are run. This is done to avoid discrepancy between ironic and
    the ramdisk on updates. Set ``update_ipa`` to ``false`` to prevent the
    ramdisk update (not recommended) or ``update_repos`` to ``false`` to
    disable any updates.
