    The default for bifrost is to enable ironic's fast_track mode using
    ironic.conf's ``[deploy]fast_track`` option which enables ironic
    to skip a power cycle sequence for deployments if the node power
    is already on and the agent is running, which is how stand-alone
    deployments tend to operate.
