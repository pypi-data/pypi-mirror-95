upgrade:
  - |
    Adds the explicit setting of file access permissions to get_url calls in
    bifrost ansible playbooks to ensure that the contents of "/httpboot" are
    world-readable independently of which Ansible version is in use.
fixes:
  - |
    Resolves the issue with ansible versions 2.9.12 and 2.8.14 where implicit
    setting of file permissions on files downloaded with get_url calls results
    in overly restrictive permissions. This leads to access denied while
    attempting to read the contents of "/httpboot" and results in failed
    deployments.
