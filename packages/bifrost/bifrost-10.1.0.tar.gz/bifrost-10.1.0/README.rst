Bifrost
-------

Bifrost (pronounced bye-frost) is a set of Ansible playbooks that
automates the task of deploying a base image onto a set of known hardware using
ironic. It provides modular utility for one-off operating system deployment
with as few operational requirements as reasonably possible.
