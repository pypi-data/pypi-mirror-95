  # FIXME: gradually fix and remove these exclusions:
  - '208'  # File permissions not mentioned
  - '301'  # Commands should not change things if nothing needs doing
  - '502'  # All tasks should be named
  - '701'  # meta/main.yml should contain relevant info
  - '702'  # Tags must contain lowercase letters and digits only
  # NOTE(dtantsur): the following rules should likely stay excluded:
  - '106'  # Role name {} does not match ``^[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$`` pattern'
  - '403'  # Package installs should not use latest
  - '503'  # Tasks that run when changed should likely be handlers
