**Newsletter and campaign management for the Django webframework.**

Django-campaign is an application for the Django webframework to make
sending out newsletters to one or more groups of subscribers easy.
If you need to send newsletters to thousands of subscribers it is easy
to integrate django-campaign with django-mailer or some email sending
providers through their APIs.

Some of the core features are:

* Multipart Emails made easy - just add a plain-text *and* a html-template.
* Full control over the Subscriber-Model and therefore the template context
  used to render the mails.
* Add context processors to add whatever you need to a mail template based on
  the recipient. This makes it easy to personalize messages.
* Allow viewing of the newsletters online and add a link to the web version
  to the outgoing emails.
* simple and optional subscribe/unsubscribe handling
