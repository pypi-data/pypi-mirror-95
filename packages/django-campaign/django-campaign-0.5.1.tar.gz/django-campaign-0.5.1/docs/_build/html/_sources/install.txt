============
Installation
============

Install django-campaign with ``easy_install`` or ``pip`` or directly from
the GitHub repository.

Then add ``campaign`` and 'django.contrib.sites' to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``
setting::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'django.contrib.sites',
        'campaign',
        ...
    )

Add an entry to your URL-conf. Using ``campaign`` here is a matter of taste,
feel free to mount the app under a different URL::

    urlpatterns += patterns('',
        (r'^campaign/', include('campaign.urls'))
    )

4. Then run ``manage.py syncdb`` to create the neccessary database tables.
