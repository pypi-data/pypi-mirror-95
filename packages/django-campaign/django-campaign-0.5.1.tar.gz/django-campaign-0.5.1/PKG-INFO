        Django-campaign is a newsletter campaign management app for the Django
        webframework. It can manage multiple newsletters with different subscriberlists.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Multiple newsletters
        * Multiple subscriberlists
        * Personalization of content for every Subscriber
        * Subscriber model lives in your code and can have whatever fields you want
        * Subscriberlists are defined as orm query parameters
        * Send mails from your own Server (through Django's email mechanism)
        * Send mails through Mandrill (a transactional email service from Mailchimp)
        * Send mails through Mailgun (a transactional email service)
        * Pluggable backends for integration with other email services
        * Make newsletters available online
        * Internal blacklist
        
        Upgrading
        ---------
        
        If you are upgrading from a 0.2.x release the following changes are noteworthy:
        
        * The south migrations where removed in favor of Django 1.7 native migrations
        * The 'debug' and 'django_mailer' backends are no longer used, because setting
          Django's EMAIL_BACKEND settings to the correct value has the same effect.
