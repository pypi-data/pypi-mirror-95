================
CMS account form
================

Replace portal user's account form
with a specific `CMS form <../cms_form>`_.

Features
--------

* full control on fields and their validation
* full control on form behavior
* full test coverage

Additionally:

* validate email
* if email is changed:
   * update user's login (yes, Odoo does that w/out notifying the user!)
   * force logout
   * for reset email password to validate new email

In a basic Odoo installation the form will look like:

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Wishlist
--------

* send notification to initial email address
  to make sure the user is aware of the update
* use a 2 steps verification token and avoid resetting password
* show a nice confirmation dialog before submitting
