Description: # Cytolysis
        A python module to facilitate the automatic analysis cytosim simulations.
        By itself, it does not include many analysis functions but mostly an API.
        
        ## Installation
        ```bash
        pip3 install cytolysis
        ```
        
        ## Requirements
        Requires Python3 and modules numpy, pandas, sio_tools.  
        To visualize the simulation in iPython (Jupyter Notebook), 
        you should install [ipyvolume](https://ipyvolume.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) :
        ```bash
        conda install -c conda-forge ipyvolume
        ```
        
        ## Practical examples
        We provide several examples where we analyze the result of a simulation for an example [config file](example_data/example.cym). 
        This simulation has two asters of microtubules brought to the center by the rigidity of the microtubules and by the activity of dyneins.  
        ![](examples/example.jpg) 
        
        An example counting the number of fiber points for each filament, and at each time:
        ```bash
        python3 examples/example_fibers.py
        ```
        An example where we compute the fiber bending energy as a function of time
        ```bash
        python3 examples/example_fiber_curvature.py
        ```
        We can also analyze any cytosim class that can be reported, by creating custom objects. 
        For example, this is done here for solids and spaces :
        ```bash
        python3 examples/example_solid.py
        python3 examples/example_space.py
        ```
        Several ipython notebooks are also available in the notebook folder. 
        
        ## Interface (examples)
        Import the module : 
        ```python
        from cytolysis import cytosim_analysis as ana
        ```
        
        The main class is *Simulation*, a list of time frames. Create an instance of a simulation analysis via :
        ```python
        microtubule_reports={'points' : 'fiber_points.txt' }
        simul = ana.Simulation(reports={'microtubule': microtubule_reports},
                                config='config.cym') 
        ```
        
        You can specify analysis functions for the different simulation objects, specifying by object name :
        ```python
        def count_points(fiber):
            return fiber.shape[0]
        
        def count_fibers(frame):
            return len(frame.fibers)
        
        analyzer={}
        analyzer['microtubule'] = {'pts_number': count_points}
        analyzer['frame'] = {'fib_number': count_fibers}
        ```
        
        You can then run the analysis :
        ```python
        simul.make_analysis(analyzer=analyzer)
        ```
        
        The analysis of objects is stored as pandas dataframes in the frames. For exemple, the analysis of microtubules for frame *5* is stored in :
        ```python
        simul[5].fibers_analysis['microtubule']
        ```
        Similarly, the analysis for couples 'arp_2_3' at frame 10 is stored in :
        ```python
        simul[10].couples_analysis['arp_2_3']
        ```
        Following this logic, since simul is a set of frames, the results of the analysis of all frames can be accessed in :
        ```python
        simul.frames_analysis
        ```
        
        The module contains a function to export analysis dataframes into csv files :
        ```python
        ana.export_analysis(simul.frames_analysis, 'frames.csv')
        ```
        
        There is also experimental support for showing the system in 3D in notebooks :
        ```python
        simul.show(frame_number)
        ```
        
        
        ## Components
        
        ### Simulation
        The class *Simulation* is a set of *frames*, instances of the class [Frame](#frame). Input arguments : 
        - reports : a dictionary of dictionaries of pathes to report files.
        - options : a dictionary of dictionaries of options.
        - config : path to the config file
        
        Simulation has a method *make_analysis* to perform the analysis. 
        This takes as option *analyzer*, a dictionary of dictionaries of analysis functions.  
        
        *simulation.make_analysis* performs the analysis specified in *analyzer["simulation"]*, 
        and the result is stored in *simulation.analysis*.  
        
        As a set of frames , simulation implements *simulation.analyze(frame, analyzer=..., ... )* (see [Object_set](#object_set)).
        This performs the analysis specified in *analyzer['frame']*. The results are stored in *simulation.frames_analysis*
         
        ### Frame
        Each frame contains several types of dictionaries of object_set : *fibers*,  *couples*, *objects* (this last one being generic).  
        Each dictionary is of the type : { name : [object_set](#object_set) }.
        These dictionaries are :
        - *frame.fibers*
        - *frame.couples*
        - *frame.objects*
        
        Once the analysis has been performed, the analysis results are stored in :
        - *frame.fibers_analysis*
        - *frame.couples_analysis*
        - *frame.objects_analysis*
        
        Frame implements the analysis method *frame.make_analysis(...)* that calls the *object_set.analyze(object, ...)* method of all object sets. 
         
        ### Object_set
        Object set is a class derived from list. *Fibers_set* and *Couples_set* are derived from *Object_set*. Input arguments :
        - *name* : name of the object (e.g. "microtubule")
        - *type* : type of the object (e.g. "fiber")  
        Optional input arguments :
        - *config* : the pile read from the configuration file
        - *build* : a function to build the object set from the reports  
         
        Beyond the initialization (*__init__*) method, object set need to implement the methods :
        - *object_set.analyze(object, ... )* : a function that analyzes *object*, a given item from the object set
        - *object_set.type* : object type 
        - *object_set.name* : object name 
        - *object_set.id* : object id (a number) 
        - *object_set.properties* : a dictionary of properties read from the config file
        - *object_set.show* : a way to plot the object set in 3D using iPyVolume
        
        ### Analysis
        All the analysis results (*simulation.analysis*, *frame.fibers_analysis*, etc.) are stored as Pandas dataframes and, by default, exported as csv files.
        - *frame.fibers_analysis[fiber_name]* is a dataframe with as many rows as there are fibers.
        - *frame.couples_analysis[couple_name]* is a dataframe with as many rows as there are couples.
        - *frame.objects_analysis[object_name]* is a dataframe with as many rows as there are objects.
        - *simulation.frame_analysis* is a dataframe with as many rows as there are frames.
        - *simulation.analysis* is a dataframe with a single row.
        
        Therefore, if one wants to look at the distribution of some property among objects for a given frame, 
        one would export *frame.object_analysis[object_name]*.  
        If one wants to analyze something over time, one would export *simulation.frame_analysis*.  
        If one wants a single line to sumarize the simulation, for instance in order to compare different simulations, one would
        export *simulation.analysis*.
        
        ### Plotting
        When used in iPython, cytolysis can represent the system in 3D, 
        and allows to plot objects differently according to their properties, 
        see this [example](notebooks/display_examples.ipynb).
