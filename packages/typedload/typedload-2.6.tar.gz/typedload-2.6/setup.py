    long_description='''Load and dump json-like data into typed data structures.

This module provides an API to load dictionaries and lists (usually loaded
from json) into Python's NamedTuples, dataclass, sets, enums, and various
other typed data structures; respecting all the type-hints and performing
type checks or casts when needed.

It can also dump from typed data structures to json-like dictionaries and lists.

It is very useful for projects that use Mypy and deal with untyped data
like json, because it guarantees that the data will have the expected format.
