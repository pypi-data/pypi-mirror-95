Description: # Picovoice Shepherd
        
        Made in Vancouver, Canada by [Picovoice](https://picovoice.ai)
        
        Picovoice Shepherd is the first no-code platform for building voice interfaces on microcontrollers.
        It enables creating voice experiences similar to Alexa that run entirely on microcontrollers. 
        Picovoice Shepherd accelerates prototyping, mitigates technical risks, and shortens time to market. 
        Paired with [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/) users can deploy custom voice models into microcontrollers instantly.
        
        ## Compatibility
        
        - Linux (x86_64)
        - macOS (x86_64)
        - Windows (x86_64)
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install the Picovoice Shepherd:
        
        ```shell
        pip3 install pvshepherd
        ```
        
        ### Note for macOS
        
        Install Python using either the [official installer](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/) or [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). Shepherd cannot run using the Python shipped with macOS. If using the Homebrew Python, make sure that `/usr/local/bin` is in the `PATH` variable before installing Shepherd.
        
        ### Note for Windows
        
        The default Python installation options do not add it to the Windows `PATH` variable. To fix the issue, refer to this [link](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#setting-envvars).
        
        ## Usage
        
        Run the following command from the terminal:
        
        ```shell
        pvshepherd
        ```
        
        > On Linux, Shepherd will ask for the root password only on the first launch.
