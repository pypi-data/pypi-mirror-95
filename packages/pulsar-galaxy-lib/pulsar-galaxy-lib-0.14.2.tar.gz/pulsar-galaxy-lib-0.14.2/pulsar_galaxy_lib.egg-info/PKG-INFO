        This project is a Python server application that allows a `Galaxy
        <http://galaxyproject.org>`_ server to run jobs on remote systems (including
        Windows) without requiring a shared mounted file systems. Unlike traditional
        Galaxy job runners - input files, scripts, and config files may be transferred
        to the remote system, the job is executed, and the results are transferred back
        to the Galaxy server - eliminating the need for a shared file system.
        
        Full documentation for the project can be found on `Read The Docs
        <https://pulsar.readthedocs.io/>`_.
        
        ------------------
        Configuring Galaxy
        ------------------
        
        Galaxy job runners are configured in Galaxy's ``job_conf.xml`` file. Some small
        examples of how to configure this can be found `here
        <https://pulsar.readthedocs.org/en/latest/galaxy_conf.html>`__, but be sure
        to check out ``job_conf.xml.sample_advanced`` in your Galaxy code base or on
        `Github
        <https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/master/config/job_conf.xml.sample_advanced>`_
        for complete information.
        
        ------------------
        Quickstart
        ------------------
        
        Full details on different ways to install Pulsar can be found in the `install
        section <https://pulsar.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html>`__ of the
        documentaiton, but if your machine has the proper Python dependencies
        available it can be quickly download and a test job run with::
        
            $ mkdir pulsar
            $ cd pulsar
            $ python3 -m venv venv
            $ . venv/bin/activate    # venv\Scripts\activate.bat on Windows
            $ pip install 'pulsar-app[web]'
            $ pulsar-config
            $ pulsar --daemon        # just `pulsar` on Windows
            $ pulsar-check           # runs a test job
        
        Please note that as of the 0.14.0 release, Pulsar no longer supports any version
        of Python 2. The minimum supported Python version is 3.5.
        
        The `configuration documentation
        <https://pulsar.readthedocs.org/en/latest/configure.html>`__
        has many details on securing your Pulsar server and enabling advanced features
        such as cluster integration and message queue communication.
        
        -----------------------
        Development and Testing
        -----------------------
        
        The recommended approach to setting up a development environment for Pulsar on
        Linux or macOS is rougly as follows::
        
            $ git clone https://github.com/galaxyproject/pulsar
            $ cd pulsar
            $ python3 -m venv .venv
            $ . .venv/bin/activate    # .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
            $ pip install -e '.[web]'
            $ pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
        
        The ``-e`` flag to ``pip`` installs Pulsar in "editable" mode, meaning that
        changes you make to the source code will be reflected when running the pulsar
        commands installed in the virtual environment.
        
        This project is distributed with unit and integration tests (many of which will
        not run under Windows), the following command will install the needed python
        components to run these tests. The following command will then run these tests::
        
            $ make tests
        
        The following command will then produce a coverage report corresponding to this
        test and place it in the ``coverage_html_report`` subdirectory of this
        project.::
        
            $ coverage html

        This documentation is an incomplete work in progress. There are more ways to
        configure and use Pulsar than are documented, and a growing number of Pulsar
        experts who would be more than happy to answer your questions and help with any
        problems you may run in to while setting up a Pulsar deployment. Please do not
