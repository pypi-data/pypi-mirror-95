# gitlab_lint

This is a CLI application to quickly lint .gitlab-ci.yml files using the gitlab api. This can easily be added as a pre-commit step to locally catch any issues with your configuration prior to pushing your changes.

## Installation
```python3 -m pip install -U gitlab_lint```

## Configuration
You can set the following environmental variables:

`GITLAB_LINT_DOMAIN` - Which allows you to override the default gitlab.com domain, and point at a local instance

`GITLAB_LINT_TOKEN` - If your .gitlab-ci.yml contains any includes, you may need to set a private token to pull data from those other repos

`GITLAB_LINT_PROJECT` - If your .gitlab-ci.yml contains any includes which source from your local repo, you may set your project ID. If your repo is private, you must set your token as well.

 I would recommend adding these to your ~/.profile or ~/.bash_profile

## Parameters

| Flag | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| --domain | Gitlab Domain. You can set envvar `GITLAB_LINT_DOMAIN` | string | `gitlab.com` | no |
| --project | Gitlab Project ID. You can set envvar `GITLAB_LINT_PROJECT` | string | `None` | no |
| --token | Gitlab Personal Token. You can set envvar `GITLAB_LINT_TOKEN`  | string | `None`| no |
| --path | Path to .gitlab-ci.yml, defaults to local directory | string | `.gitlab-ci.yml` | no |
| --verify | Enables HTTPS verification, which is disabled by default to support privately hosted instances | Flag | `False` | no |

## Example Usage
If your .gitlab-ci.yml is in the current directory it is as easy as:
```
$ gll
GitLab CI configuration is valid

```

Failures will appear like so:
```
$ gll
GitLab CI configuration is invalid
(<unknown>): could not find expected ':' while scanning a simple key at line 26 column 1
```

If you need to you can specify the path:
```
$ gll --path path/to/.gitlab-ci.yml
GitLab CI configuration is valid

```

If you choose not to set the envvars for domain and token you can pass them in as flags:
```
$ gll --path path/to/.gitlab-ci.yml --domain gitlab.mycompany.com --project 1234 --token <gitlab personal token>
GitLab CI configuration is valid

```


Https verification is disabled by default to support privately hosted instances, if you would like to enable pass the `--verify | -v` flag

```
$ gll --verify
GitLab CI configuration is valid

```
