### Tell me more!

I wanted an easy way to grab the songs present in my library so I can download it & use it offline. [spotify_to_mp3](https://github.com/frosas/spotify-to-mp3) worked well but it relied on grooveshark, which unfortunately is no more. So I wrote this script which mimics that library, but instead of downloading from grooveshark, it searches YouTube and downloads the song using [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/).

### How do I get this thing running?

Install using pip

    pip3 install spotify_dl

Run the program 

    spotify_dl -l spotify_playlist_link -o download_directory

For running in verbose mode, append `-V`

    spotify_dl -V -l spotify_playlist_link -o download_directory

For more details and other arguments, issue `-h`

    spotify_dl -h

See [the getting started guide](https://github.com/SathyaBhat/spotify-dl/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md) for more details.
