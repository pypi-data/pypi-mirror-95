Some text before section title.


Further<br>Nested"Document
==========================

This is a nested document within a :doc:`nested document <nested document>`.

To check whether HTML escaping works, both the file name and the title contain
strange characters.
The double quotes character in the title is only problematic when
:confval:`smartquotes` is set to ``False``.
