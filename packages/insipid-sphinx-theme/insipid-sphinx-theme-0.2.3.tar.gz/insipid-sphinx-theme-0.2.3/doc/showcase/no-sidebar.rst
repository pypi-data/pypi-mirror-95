Page Without Sidebar
====================

This page has no sidebar,
because an empty list of sidebar templates was chosen for
:confval:`html_sidebars` in :download:`conf.py <../conf.py>`:

.. literalinclude:: ../conf.py
    :name: conf-py-html-sidebars
    :caption: conf.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:
    :lineno-match:
    :start-at: html_sidebars
    :end-at: }

If you don't want to show the sidebar at all,
you can disable it globally with the theme option :theme-option:`nosidebar`.
