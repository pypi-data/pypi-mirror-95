PyDoc_STRVAR(ratio_docstring,
R"(ratio($module, s1, s2, processor = None, score_cutoff = 0)
--

calculates a simple ratio between two strings. This is a simple wrapper
for string_metric.normalized_levenshtein using the weights:
- weights = (1, 1, 2)

Parameters
----------
s1 : str
    First string to compare.
s2 : str
    Second string to compare.
processor: bool or callable, optional
  Optional callable that is used to preprocess the strings before
  comparing them. When processor is True ``utils.default_process``
  is used. Default is None, which deactivates this behaviour.
score_cutoff : float, optional
    Optional argument for a score threshold as a float between 0 and 100.
    For ratio < score_cutoff 0 is returned instead. Default is 0,
    which deactivates this behaviour.

Returns
-------
ratio : float
    ratio distance between s1 and s2 as a float between 0 and 100

Examples
--------
>>> fuzz.ratio("this is a test", "this is a test!")
96.55171966552734
