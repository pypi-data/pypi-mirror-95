    Instances of ``cliff.columns.FormattableColumn`` are now comparable. This
    allows implementations of ``FormattableColumn`` storing primitive data
    types or containers with primitive data types to be sorted using the
    ``--sort-column`` option. Implementations of ``FormattableColumn`` that
    store other types of data will still need to implement their own rich
    comparison magic methods.
