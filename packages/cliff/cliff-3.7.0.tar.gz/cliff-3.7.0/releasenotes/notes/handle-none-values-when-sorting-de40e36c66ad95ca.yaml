    Sorting output using the ``--sort-column`` option will now handle ``None``
    values. This was supported implicitly in Python 2 but was broken in the
    move to Python 3. In addition, requests to sort a column containing
    non-comparable types will now be ignored. Previously, these request would
    result in a ``TypeError``.
