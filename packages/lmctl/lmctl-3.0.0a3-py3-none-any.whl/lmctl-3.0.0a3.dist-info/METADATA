LMCTL is a command-line client that provides commands for interacting with IBM Telco Network Cloud Manager (TNCM) Orchestrator (TNCO/ALM) environments. 

In addition it includes an opinionated pattern for managing xNF/Network Service designs during the CICD lifecycle, as file based projects, to produce packages suitable for production release.
