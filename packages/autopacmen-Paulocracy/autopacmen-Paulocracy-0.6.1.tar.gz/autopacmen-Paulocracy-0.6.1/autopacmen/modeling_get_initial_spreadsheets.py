    For the application of sMOMENT, the following spreadsheets are relevant (ยง stands for the given project name):
    * ยง_enzyme_stoichiometries.xlsx: here, the user can enter intra-complex stoichiometries of the proteins
      which constitute the complex
    * ยง_protein_data: here, the user has to enter the data for the calculation of the protein pool. Optionally,
      the user can also enter proteomic concentration data for each protein.

    Example
    ----------
    Suppose we want to create the initial spreadsheets for the SBML 'C:\\Test.xml' and have the project folder
    'C:\\folder' and the project name 'project':
    <pre>
    python modeling_get_initial_spreadsheets.py --sbml_path C:\\Test.xml --project_folder C:\\folder --project_name project
