Description: PyMCUTK Overview [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Hoohaha/pymcutk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Hoohaha/pymcutk)
        ==============
        
        
        PyMCUTK is a python based toolkit for NXP MCUXpresso SDK. And it aims to proivide easy-to-use tools to work with MCUXpresso SDK. The project focus on toolchains and their projects, debuggers, and NXP MCU boards support.
        
        Simple command line could make you can quicky get start. We have many hard works and you may won't repeat. That is what PyMCUTK design for.
        
        ## Prerequisites
        
        - Python 3 >= 3.4 or (python 2 >= 2.9)
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        - Simply installation with pip:
        
            ```bash
            pip install pymcutk
            ```
        
        - Install from source code, firstly clone the git repository from [Github-PyMCUTK](https://github.com/Hoohaha/pymcutk),
        and run below command in project root:
        
            ```
            pip install .
            ```
        
        - Once installed, try below command to test:
        
            ```bash
            mtk --version
            ```
        
        ## Quickly start
        
        
        ### Command line usage
        
        
        ```bash
        # Build projects in current directory.
        $ mtk build .
        
        # Build specific configuration: sdram_release
        $ mtk build . -t sdram_release
        
        # Recursive mode and dump results to CSV format.
        $ mtk build ./mcu-sdk-2.0/boards/ -r --results-csv
        
        # Scan Projects dump to json format
        $ mtk scan ./mcu-sdk-2.0/boards/ -o test.json
        ```
        
        
        
        ## Supported toolchains
        
        - [NXP MCUXpresso IDE](https://www.nxp.com/support/developer-resources/software-development-tools/mcuxpresso-software-and-tools/mcuxpresso-integrated-development-environment-ide:MCUXpresso-IDE)
        - [ARM MDK](http://www2.keil.com/mdk5)
        - [IAR Embedded Workbench](https://www.iar.com/iar-embedded-workbench/)
        - [GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm)
        
        ### Configuration
        
        MCUTK could automatically discover the installed toolchains from your system as usual.
        If you hope to use another version, you can edit the config file: ~/.mcutk.
        
        Run bellow command that will initialize the configuration file, which is saved at ~/.mcutk.
        
        ```bash
        $ mtk config --auto
        ```
        
        
        ### Unittest
        
        Before create pull requests, please do a test in your local to check mistakes.
        
        pytest command:
        
        ```bash
        pytest .
        ```
