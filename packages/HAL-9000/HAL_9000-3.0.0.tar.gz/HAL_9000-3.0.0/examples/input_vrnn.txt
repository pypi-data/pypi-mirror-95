Yeah, this album is dedicated
To all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothin'
To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin' in front of
Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughter (it's all good)
And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby
It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed in Bambu, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood
It's all good (It's all good)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
You know very well
Who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down
Reach for the stars
You had a goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty
I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap
I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Moët and Alizé keep me pissy
Girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rappin' stuff
I was too used to packin' gats and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold-out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Livin' life without fear
Puttin' five karats in my baby girl's ear
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
You know very well
Who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down
Reach for the stars
You had a goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty
Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this
50-inch screen, money-green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is loungin'
Celebratin' every day, no more public housin'
Thinkin' back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps a Ac' with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip Champagne when we thirsty
Uh, damn right, I like the life I live
'Cause I went from negative to positive
And it's all (It's all good, nigga)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
You know very well
Who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
Reach for the stars
You had a goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
I'll give you good and plenty
Representin' B-Town in the house
Junior Mafia, mad flavor
Uh, uh, yeah, aight
You know very well
Who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down
Reach for the stars
You had a goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty
Biggie Smalls, it's all good, nigga
Junior Mafia, it's all good, nigga
Bad Boy, it's all good, nigga
It's all good
That's right, '94
And on and on, and on and on
You know very well
Who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down
Reach for the stars
Uh, uh, check it out (yeah), uh
Junior M.A.f.i.a., uh (hehe, mm)
Uh (I like this) yeah, yeah
Nine-fo' (keep bangin')
To all the ladies in the place with style and grace
Allow me to lace these lyrical douches, in your bushes (uh)
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mommies
The back of the club, sippin' Moet, is where you'll find me (what?)
The back of the club, mackin' hoes, my crew's behind me (uh)
Mad question askin', blunt passin', music blastin'
But I just can't quit
Because one of these honies Biggie gots ta creep with
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret, why not
Why blow up my spot 'cause we both got hot?
Now check it, I got more Mack than Craig and in the bed
Believe me sweetie I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy I got mad friends with Benz's
C-notes by the layers, true fuckin' players (uh)
Jump in the Rover and come over
Tell your friends jump in the GS3
I got the chronic by the tree, 'cause
Throw your hands in the air, if you's a true player
(I love it when you call me Big Poppa)
To the honies gettin' money playin' niggas like dummies
(I love it when you call me Big Poppa)
Ya got a gun up in your waist, please don't shoot up the place (why?)
'Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be havin' my baby (uh), baby (uh)
Straight up honey really I'm askin'
Most of these niggas think they be mackin', but they be actin'
Who they attractin' with that line, "What's your name, what's your sign?"
Soon as he buy that wine I just creep up from behind
And ask what your interests are, who you be with
Things to make you smile, what numbers to dial
You gon' be here for a while, I'm gon' go call my crew
You go call your crew
We can rendezvous at the bar around two
Plans to leave, throw the keys to 'Lil Cease
Pull the truck up, front, and roll up the next blunt
So we can steam on the way to the telly go fill my belly
A t-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape
Conversate for a few, 'cause in a few, we gon' do
What we came to do, ain't that right boo (true)
Forget the telly we just go to the crib
And watch a movie in the jacuzzi smoke L's while you do me
Throw your hands in the air, if you's a true player
(I love it when you call me Big Poppa)
To the honies gettin' money playin' niggas like dummies, uh
(I love it when you call me Big Poppa)
Ya got a gun up in your waist, please don't shoot up the place (why?)
'Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be havin' my baby, baby (uh)
In mansion and Benz's givin' ends to my friends and it feels stupendous
Tremendous cream, fuck a dollar and a dream
Still tote gats strapped with infrared beams (what?)
Choppin O's, smokin' lye an' Optimo's
Money hoes and clothes all a nigga knows (all a nigga knows)
A foolish pleasure, whatever
I had to find the buried treasure (for what?), So grams I had to measure
However living better now, Gucci sweater now
Drop top BM's, I'm the man girlfriend
Honey check it (check it)
tell your friends, to get with my friends (your friends)
And we can be friends
shit we can do this every weekend (that's right)
Aight? Is that aight with you?
Yeah, keep bangin'
I love it when you call me Big Poppa)
Throw your hands in the air, if you's a true player
(I love it when you call me Big Poppa)
To the honies gettin' money playin' niggas like dummies, uh
(I love it when you call me Big Poppa)
Ya got a gun up in your waist, please don't shoot up the place (why?)
'Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be havin' my baby, baby (uh)
Check it out, nine-fo' shit for dat ass, uh
Puff Daddy, Biggie Smalls, Junior M.A.F.I.A, represent baby, baby, uh
Uh, uh, uh, c'mon
Hah, sicka than your average
Poppa twist cabbage off instinct
Niggas don't think shit stink, pink gators,
My Detroit players
Timbs for my hooligans in Brooklyn
Dead right, if the head right, Biggie there ery'night
Poppa been smooth since days of Underroos
Never lose, never choose to, bruise crews who
Do something to us, talk go through us
Girls walk to us, wanna do us, screw us
Who us? Yeah, Poppa and Puff (hehehe)
Close like Starsky and Hutch, stick the clutch
Dare I squeeze three at your cherry M-3 (Take that, take that, take that, haha!)
Bang every MC easily, busily
Recently niggas frontin ain't sayin' nuttin' (nope) so I just
Speak my piece, (c'mon) keep my piece
Cubans with the Jesus piece (thank you God), with my peeps
Packin', askin' who want it, you got it nigga flaunt it
That Brooklyn bullshit, we on it

All Philly hoes, dough and Moschino (c'mon)
Every cutie wit a booty bought a Coogi (hah!)
Now who's the real dookie, meanin' who's really the shit
Them niggas ride dicks, Frank White push the sticks
On the Lexus, LX, four and a half
Bulletproof glass tints if I want some ass
Gon' blast squeeze first ask questions last
That's how most of these so-called gangsters pass
At last, a nigga rappin' bout blunts and broads
Tits and bras, menage-a-tois, sex in expensive cars
I still leave you on the pavement
Condo paid for, no car payment
At my arraignment, note for the plantiff
Your daughter's tied up in a Brooklyn basement (shhh)
Face it, not guilty, that's how I stay filthy (not guilty)
Richer than Richie, till you niggas come and get me
Biggie Biggie Biggie can't you see

Flows girls say he's sweet like licorice
So get with this nigga, it's easy
Girlfriend here's a pen, call me round ten
Come through, have sex on rugs that's Persian (that's right)
Come up to your job, hit you while you workin' (uh) for certain,
Poppa freakin', not speakin'
Leave that ass leakin, like rapper demo
Tell them hoe, take they clothes off slowly
Hit 'em wit' the force like Obe, dick black like Toby (Obe, Toby)
Watch me roam like Gobe, lucky they don't owe me
Where the safe show me, homey (say what, homey)

Armed and dangerous, ain't too many can bang with us
Straight up weed, no angel dust, label us "Notorious"
Thug ass niggas that love to bust, it's strange to us
Y'all niggas be scrambling, gambling
Up in restaurants with mandolins and violins
We just sitting here tryna win, try not to sin
High off weed and lots of gin
So much smoke need oxygen, steadily counting them Benjamins
Nigga you should too, if you knew what this game'll do to you
Been in this shit since '92, look at all the bullshit I been through!
So-called beef with you-know-who
Fucked a few female stars or two
Nigga, blue light, nigga, move like Mike, shit
Not to be fucked with
Motherfucker better duck quick 'cause
Me and my dogs love to buck shit
Fuck the luck shit, strictly aim
No aspirations to quit the game
Spit your game, talk your shit
Grab your Gat, call your clique
Squeeze your clip, hit the right one
Pass that weed, I got to light one
All them niggas, I got to fight one
All them hoes, I got to like one
Our situation is a tight one
Whatcha gonna do, fight or run?
Seems to me that you'll take B
Bone and Big, nigga: die slowly
I'mma tell you like a nigga told me
Cash rules everything around me
Shit lyrically, niggas can't see me
Fuck it, buy the coke
Cook the coke, cut it
Know the bitch 'fore you caught yourself loving it
Nigga with a Benz fuckin' it
Doesn't it seem odd to you?
Big come through with mobs and crews
Goodfellas down to the Mo' Thugs dudes
Who's the killer, me or you?
7 A.M., woke in the morning
With Hen' and caffeine and green and nicotine
No dough, so pop a couple of doze
Lil' RIPsta, nigga Mista Clean
Nigga Dean, deep in my temple and not to get
Sentimentally steamed with my
Instrumelody, and heated
Especially for your team
And a .45, indeed, will beam
In between the scenes. Destroy your dreams
You willing to die? we'll see
How many flee when I 'cause the scene
We mean mug, Mo' Thugs
Trained to be perfect disciples
When it's survival, tongue is a double-edged sword
Triple six rivals spitting fire
This the real truth, bitch
Breaking out for lies
My Messiahs better be ready for Armageddon, shit's expired
It's wild, bless the child
The one that became a man
Put in positions off in the Clair
All that I had to do was stare
Test me now. Contender never no surrender, no pretend
Pick up my pen, in my hand
One of my trusted friend-friends, hey
Open it! Let's see if we're real, we all suited
Beg my pardon to Martin
Baby we ain't marching, we shooting!
In daily recruiting there's a thug born
Everyday in the ghetto
We start em off little, we give em a bible
And a pen and a pad to hit the label, kick it
Nigga roll with Bone up into the Thug spot
To the dome with a shot of bird
Never get tossed to the curb
Be feeling that urge to splurge
But I'm broke as fuck, Sin, gimme that Mossberg swerve
Up into my bag, 'cause I gotta get my mask and shells
To put in this 12-gauge sawed-off
Get 'em hauled off, nigga your loss, take it all off
Got a nigga caught off
But the Bone not Leatherface, too many are thinking they thugs
And little Mo Hart want to pull it and bust it
And bitch if you steppin' we buckin' them guts, that's fucked up
Now let me get done with the grime
Gotta go purchase a dime
Put in a state to get done with the crime
Smoking the reefer to ease my mind
Swig some wine, step on the block with the rocks
But really we be serving em dummies, see?
Gotta buck him on down if he come back talking
Like, gimme back me money
Thugging with me killers
Need us a liter of liquor but niggas ain't got shit
With a sawed-off pump, chrome .38 pistol
Now who ready to get bent?
Nigga like me fiending for them green leaves
But I ain't had no dough
Gotta make some money, so
I'm making my dummy rocks if I go broke
It's Bone and Biggie, Biggie, It's Bone and Biggie, Biggie (we gonna rock the party)
It's Bone and Biggie, Biggie, It's Bone and Biggie, Biggie (Rock the party, party)
It's Bone and Biggie, Biggie, It's Bone and Biggie, Biggie (better run and tell everybody)
It's Bone and Biggie, Biggie, It's Bone and Biggie, Biggie
Let's ride let's ride let's ride let's ride
Get high, get high, get high, c'mon
Let's ride let's ride let's ride let's ride
Get high, get high, get high
Yeah, Little Lay, hey, coming in the form of scripture
Finna get you and hit you with magic
Droppin down lead but I call it my gadgets
With an automatic-status, we spray, time to load the Glocks
But I'm thinking not
There's another evil force tellin' me to do what I gotta do
So I up my pipe, a nigga dyin' tonight
And I'm always running from the boys in blue
Biggie, blue's on my ass, pull out the cellular phone to call Bone
What's happenin'?
Grab artillery, a nigga start packing
'Cause a motherfucker tried to get me in a jackin, and I did him
Hit him right between the eyes, the spot was wise
Wanna test a nigga size, it'll cost him
Nigga fuck around with the wrong shit
Y'all get mo' murdered all day, all day
We done paved the way and I'm on the run
I'mma call my boys and bring all the guns
Y'all niggas wanna have a little fun with #1?
Bloody red red rum rum rum rum rum rum
That red red rum rum rum rum rum rum
That red red rum
