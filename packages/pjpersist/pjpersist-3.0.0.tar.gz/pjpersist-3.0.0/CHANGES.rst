3.0.0 (2021-02-22)
------------------

- Backwards incompatible change: PJDataManager now accepts a pool instead
  of connection object. PJDataManager will get the connection from the pool
  when joining the transaction, and return it back when transaction
  completes (aborts or commits). This allows for more flexible connection
  management. The connection pool must implement IPJConnectionPool interface
  (it is compatible with psycopg2.pool).

- `IPJDataManager.begin()` is renamed to `setTransactionOptions()`

- Errors executing SQL statements now doom the entire transaction,
  causing `transaction.interfaces.DoomedTransaction` exception on
  any attempts to commit it.  A failed transaction must be aborted.


2.0.1 (2020-10-13)
------------------

- Fixed persisting tuple keyed dicts. Persisting such objects worked,
  but reading failed.


2.0.0 (2020-06-02)
------------------

- Drop Python 2.7 and 3.6 support, add 3.8.

- Remove buildout support.

- Support for nested flushing. In complex use cases it can happen that during
  serialization of an object, a query is made to look up another object. That
  in turn causes a flush, resulting in a flush inside a flush. The `flush()`
  method did not expect that behavior and failed if the inner flush would
  flush objects that the outer flush had already handled.


1.7.2 (2020-02-10)
------------------

- Optimization: do not dig in `data` when we have a native field for
  `_pj_mapping_key`, should allow creating indexes for lookup


1.7.1 (2019-06-19)
------------------

- Fixed an edge case when the serializer gets a mapping with a key `dict_data`.
  Reading such object failed.

- Fixed an edge case with the serializer, when an object's state living
  in a persistent object became 'empty'. Basically the state was just
  `{'_py_persistent_type': 'SomeClass'}`
  `SomeClass.__setstate__` was not called, thus the object could miss
  attributes. Like a subclass of `UserDict` would miss the `data` attribute.

- Removed checking for 0x00 chars in dict keys. Turns out PostGreSQL just
  can not store 0x00.

1.7.0 (2019-05-29)
------------------

- Support for sub-second datetime and time resolution during serialization.

- Add `use_cache` argument to `PJContainer._load_one()` to support ignoring
  the cache. (This became handy if a container keeps track of multiple
  versions of an item and you try to load all old revisions.)


1.6.0 (2019-05-29)
------------------

- Make `id` and `data` column name configurable via `_pj_id_column` and
  `_pj_data_column` attributes in `PJContainer`, respectively.

- Auto-assign a name to objects when using `PJContainer`, not just
  `IdNamesPJContainer`.


1.5.0 (2018-10-10)
------------------

- Support for Python 3.7. Removed Python 3.5 testing from tox.


1.4.1 (2018-09-13)
------------------

- No need to log in tpc_finish.


1.4.0 (2018-09-13)
------------------

- Implemented skipping tpc_prepare when DM has no writes.
  We found out that AWS Aurora is dog slow at the moment on tpc_prepare.
  When the DataManager has no writes, there's no need to call tpc_prepare.
  See `CALL_TPC_PREPARE_ON_NO_WRITE_TRANSACTION`, by default True for backwards
  compatibility.

- Added ability to log whether the transaction had writes.
  See `LOG_READ_WRITE_TRANSACTION`, by default False


1.3.2 (2018-04-19)
------------------

- More precise flushing of datamanager to avoid unnecessary database
  writes.


1.3.1 (2018-04-11)
------------------

- Enabled concurrent adds to IdNamesPJContainer by eliminating a query
  that was causing transaction conflicts.

1.3.0 (2018-03-22)
------------------

- Python 3 compatibility fixes
- More efficient PJContainer.values() implementation


1.2.2 (2017-12-12)
------------------

- Need to protect all DB calls against `DatabaseDisconnected`


1.2.1 (2017-12-12)
------------------

- `psycopg2.OperationalError` and `psycopg2.InterfaceError` will be caught
  on SQL command execution and reraised as `DatabaseDisconnected`


1.2.0 (2017-10-24)
------------------

- Added a new helper function to link subobject to main doc object. This is
  needed when a custom `__getstate__()` and `__setstate__()` is implemented. A
  detailed example is provided.

- Implemented `flush_hint` argument for `IDataManager.execute()` to allow
  flushing only some objects during query. `flush_hints` is a list table names
  that need to be flushed for the query to return a correct result.

- The Zope-specific containers use the `flush_hint` to only flush objects they
  manage when a query is run on the container.

- While flushing objects, every main document object is now only flushed
  once. Before that fix, any subobject would cause its doc object to be dumped
  again.

Note: These optimizations provide a 15% performance improvements in real-world
applications.


1.1.2 (2017-09-14)
------------------

- Make sure changed objects aren't `_p_changed` anymore after commit.


1.1.1 (2017-07-03)
------------------

- Nothing changed yet.


1.0.0 (2017-03-18)
------------------

- Initial Public Release

- Project forked from mongopersist to work with PostGreSQL and JSONB data
  type. The main motiviation is the ability to utilize PostGreSQL's great
  transactional support.
