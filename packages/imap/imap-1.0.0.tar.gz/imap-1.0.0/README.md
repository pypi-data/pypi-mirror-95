# iMAP - Integration of multiple single-cell datasets by adversarial paired transfer networks

### Installation

#### 1. Prerequisites

<ul>
    <li>Install Python >= 3.6. Typically, you should use the Linux system and install a newest version of <a href='https://www.anaconda.com/'>Anaconda</a> or <a href = 'https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html'> Miniconda </a>.</li>
    <li>Install pytorch >= 1.1.0. To obtain the optimal performance of deep learning-based models, you should have a Nivdia GPU and install the appropriate version of CUDA. (We tested with CUDA = 9.0)</li>
    <li> Install scanpy >= 1.5.1 for pre-processing. </li>
    <li>(Optional) Install <a href='https://github.com/slundberg/shap'>SHAP</a> for interpretation.</li>
</ul>

#### 2. Installation
