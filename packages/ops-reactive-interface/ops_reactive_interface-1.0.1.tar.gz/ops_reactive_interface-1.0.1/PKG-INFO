Description: # ops-reactive-interface
        
        This library is a helper for developers creating interface protocol API
        libraries for charms. The goal is to allow the developer to focus on
        implementing the API library using the best practices from the [Operator
        framework][] pattern and still enable usage in older charms which have yet to be
        transitioned from the [charms.reactive framework][] with minimal additional
        developer and resource overhead.
        
        ## Usage
        
        All that is required to use this library is to add a bit of info to your
        interface protocol API library's `setup.py` to include this as a dependency and
        to register your API classes with the role and interface protocol name they
        implement. Full details can be found in [the docs](docs), as well as an
        [example](docs/example.md) which shows an interface API implementation with
        usage by both an Operator framework charm and a charms.reactive charm.
