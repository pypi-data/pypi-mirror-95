Calibrations are taken from the HST spectra on the following URL:
    ftp://ftp.stsci.edu/cdbs/current_calspec/

The spectra are available as FITS tables containing at least two
columns, WAVELENGTH and FLUX in units of Angstrom and erg/s/cm2/A,
respectively.
Using the script 'convert_flux_to_mag.py', the FITS tables can be
converted to a data file for the PyNOT pipeline in AB magnitudes
for separate bandpasses.

  %] python  convert_flux_to_mag.py  *filename.fits*  *star_name*

The following options can be passed to the script:
    --output : filename for the data table
               By default the filename will be *star_name.dat*
    --size   : bandpass size in Angstrom

This file is directly compatible with the function in PyNOT which
calculates the sensitivity function.
