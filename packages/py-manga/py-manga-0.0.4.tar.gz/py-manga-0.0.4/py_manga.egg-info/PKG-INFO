        ## a library for getting information from mangaupdates.com!
        note: i am not affiliated with mangaupdates.com
        
        mangaupdates, while offering a great source of information for your favorite manga, does not properly expose an api. it just returns the page html!
        this is where py-manga comes in. using beautifulsoup, it parses all the information out of the html, making it way easier to work with.
