## a library for getting information from mangaupdates.com!

note: i am not affiliated with mangaupdates.com

mangaupdates, while offering a great source of information for your favorite manga, does not properly expose an api. it just returns the page html!
this is where py-manga comes in. using beautifulsoup, it parses all the information out of the html, making it way easier to work with.

**to see how the data is organized, see [the documentation](https://py-manga.readthedocs.io/en/latest)**
