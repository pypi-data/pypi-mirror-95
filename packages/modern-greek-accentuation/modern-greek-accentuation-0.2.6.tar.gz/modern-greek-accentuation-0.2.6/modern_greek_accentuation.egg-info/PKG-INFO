        ## Change Log
         * 0.2.6 Fixed issue with converting to monotonic function, when it would strip word also from dieresis
         * 0.2.5 Small improvements to augmentify module, now it deals correctly with accented prefixes when creating augmented stems
         * 0.2.4 Added convert_to_monotonic function
         * 0.2.3 Fixed issue with syllabification, where iota with diaeresis is not an independent vowel (roloiou), also fixed a secondary issue with accentuation, where previously redundant diaeresis was not removed in above cases.
         * 0.2.2 Fixed issue with internal augmentation with unaccented augment, now it gives such an option
         * 0.2.1 Added transcription module (simple, Erasmian and modern for Polish readers)
         * 0.1.1 Initial release
