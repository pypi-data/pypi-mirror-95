CHANGES
=======

* Add BMStats.blocks\_in\_zone() method, for easier access of finding all blocks in zone
* Add support of single precision for less storage and loading time
* Make usage of Rtree optional (only when calculating column's intersections)
* Add t2grid utility setting up rockless t2 input, each block with its own rocktype
* Test Github Action, check path
* Test add path, faster
* Test add path
* Test Github Action add-path, diff steps
* Test Github Action add-path, diff steps
* Test Github Action add-path, diff steps
* Test Gibthub Action add-path
* Test Github Action step id, fix
* Test Github Action step id
* Test Github Action environment variable
* Update documentation, use .calc\_bmstats() instead of .populate\_model()
* Add Github Action build and publish to PyPI
* Fix twine issue error with description file being markdown
* Add \_\_repr\_\_string for BMStats
* Add CM base class for CMs, add .calc\_bmstats() return BMStats objects
* Format README
* Improve README formatting, BMStats example easier to read
* Add BMStats.add\_zone(), which append a single zone stats, also updated doc on usual structure of .stats
* BMStats now checks for consistency among .stats .zones .geo, raise proper error.  Add new unit tests
* Improve BMStats .\_\_init\_\_() .save() .load(), added unit tests for empty BMStats
* Add unit test on BMStats
* Hide some prints in unit test
* Format README.md
* Add virtual env folder to .gitignore
* Remove updating apt-get, why waiwera-credo not using it?
* Update installation instructions on dependencies: shapely and rtree, on Linux
* Update installation document
* Experiment shapely and rtree installed via pip and their dependencies in apt-get
* Experiment shapely and rtree install on;y via apt-get for ubuntu in GitHub Action
* Fix Unit Tests Action dependency rtree still not able to be used
* Fix shapely still not installed properly on GitHub Action
* Fix Action failed to install rtree and shapely, try using apt-get python-rtree and python-shapely
* Fix dependency for GitHub Action Unit Tests on libgeos required by shapely
* Fix Action, needs more dependencies
* Fix GitHub Action, needs dependent libraries
* Change Action name
* Fix PyTOUGH not installed in Action for unit tests
* Not supporting Python 3 yet
* Add GitHub Action to do unit tests
* Fix unit test on CM\_Blocky, where it was called CM long time ago
* Fix issue with unittest fail because it was run from a different directory (eg. python -m unittest discover)
* Add notes on installing dependency Rtree and move up install instructions
* Add notes on installing dependency shapely and descartes
* Use pbr (Python Build Reasonableness) to manage setuptools packaging
* Fix bug of rain creation unit
* Add create rain geners without adding them into dat directly, include rain history
* Fix incorrect one atmosphere pressure (10035 pa to 10325 pa)
* Update to use PyTOUGH's t2data.json() writing waiwera json input
* Caching objects, so can call populate multiple times efficiently
* Remove comments
* Add dilation for CM Faults, stats are area ratio if dilation > 0
* Change major data structure, faults CM no longer boolen, just 1.0 and 0.0

0.1
---

* Tweak error message of fail loading BMStats
* Fix BMStats does not need to worry about atmosphere blocks
* Ensure BMStats uses relative path for npy file in .save() and .load()
* Change class ZoneStats to new name BMStats, and add class comments
* Remove excess print for testing
* Add ZoneStats.save() and ZoneStats.load()
* Fix ZoneStats stats array size, should be the same as geo.num\_blocks
* Add ZoneStats class, keeping stats info generated by CM, can add two or more CMs
* Add CM for simple polygon prism.  Giving similar stats like other CMs
* Change polygon cache property name in mulgrid object, also add dictionary
* Allow CM\_Blocky to be used in a customised way, without dealing with t2grid/geological model
* Add ability to process cascade river/lake style wet boundary conditions
* Improve column polygon caching, now can be reused
* Improve wet surface processing now can provide overwrite col surface
* Update block geology now returns new rock name
* Add utility for adding rain generators
* Add utility for adding upflows
* Add utility for adding heatflow
* Atmospheric blocks are layer zero
* Reorganise model creation codes, now external, cmflow is just a library
* Remove unused debugging code and dependency
* Reorganise directory and files a bit
* Change fault CM testing into a function
* Remove useless code, CM very slightly faster now
* Add CM for faults, still slow
* Add 3D face module for fault calculation, and its test cases
* Add .gitignore file, exclude most things apart from codes
* Roughly working, initial commit
