Same-site Cookies
=================

The `Same-site cookie RFC
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-first-party-cookies-07>`_ updates
`RFC6265 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265>`_ to include a new cookie
attribute named ``SameSite``.

WebOb provides support for setting the ``SameSite`` attribute in its cookie
APIs, using the ``samesite`` keyword argument.

In `Incrementally Better Cookies
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-cookie-incrementalism-00>`_ the
standard was altered to add an additional option for the ``SameSite``
attribute. This new option has `known incompatible clients
<https://www.chromium.org/updates/same-site/incompatible-clients>`_, please be
aware that WebOb does not attempt to sniff the user agent to know if setting
the ``SameSite`` attribute to ``None`` will cause compatibility issues.

Please refer to the API documentation for :func:`webob.cookies.make_cookie`
and :class:`webob.cookies.CookieProfile` for the keyword arguments.
