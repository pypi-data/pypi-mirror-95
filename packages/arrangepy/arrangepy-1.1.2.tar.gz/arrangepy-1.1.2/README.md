<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## What it does

Organizes the files based on their extensions in folders. 

If you run the script in a directory containing hundreds of files of multiple filetypes, the script will arrange all of them in different directories based on the file type. For example, all PDFs are arranged in a directory for PDFs, all document based files (docx, doc, xlsx, pptx etc) are moved to the **docs** directory. 

All these files are moved to a directory named **ArrangedPy** in the directory on which the script was executed. So if you ran the script on your **Downloads** directory, a directory named *ArrangedPy* will be created in **Downloads**.

You can specify which files to move to which directory using the config.ini file. 

* Read about it on my [blog](https://prashants.in/blog/CleanPy-python-script-to-organize-your-files/)


## Features

Currently it has 2 modes

- Easy mode: Organzises files in the current directory
- Hard mode: Organizes files in the current directory and its subdirectories



### Built With

* [Python](https://python.org/)
* and some dedication by the [awesome contributors](https://github.com/prashantsengar/ArrangePy/graphs/contributors)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Follow the given steps to get started with ArrangePy

### Prerequisites

You should have Python installed on your system. You can move to Installation if you have it, otherwise continue with the next steps.

* Install [Python](https://python.org/) from python.org
* Make sure to add Python to PATH if you are on Windows
* To check that Python has been installed on your PC, open Command Prompt or Terminal and type in following command
    `python --version`

This should output `Python 3.x.x` where x.x is the version of your Python installation.
Note: If that does not work, try `python3 --version` or `py --version`

In the next part of the readme, `python` will be used, change it with the command that works for your PC


### Installation

#### Installation from PyPI

* Open command prompt/terminal and type the following command

  ```sh
  pip install arrangepy
  ```
  or
  ```sh
  pip3 install arrangepy
  ```
depending on the version.

It will install ArrangePy and the required packages.

* To confirm that ArrangePy has been installed successfully, type the following command in terminal

  ```sh
  arrange -h
  ```
It should show you a message on how to use it.


#### Installation from GitHub

* Clone the ArrangePy
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/prashantsengar/ArrangePy
  ```
* Change to the project directory
  ```sh
  cd ArrangePy
  ```
* Install requirements
  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
* Run ArrangePy
  ```sh
  python -m arrangepy
  ```

For the usage examples, replace `arrange` with `python -m arrangepy`



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

```sh
usage: arrange [-h] [-w | -s | -b] [-nw] [directory]

positional arguments:
  directory          The directory to arrange, default is current working directory

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -w, --weak         Weak arrange
  -s, --strong       Strong arrange
  -b, --web          Run web GUI
  -nw, --no-warning  Don't show any warnings when running strong arrange
```

**Examples**

- `arrange` (Arranges current directory, asks for type of arrange [WEAK/STRONG] )
- `arrange -w` (Weak arranges current directory)
- `arrange -w PATH/TO/DIRECTORY` (Weak arranges given directory)
- `arrange -s -nw PATH/TO/DIRECTORY` (Strong arranges given directory without any warning)


### Running the Web GUI

- `arrange -b` # for the web interface


### Editing the CONFIG file

You can edit the config.ini file to change how the directories are created.
Say the initial configuration is this:

```
[ext]
PDF=['pdf'],
Images=['png','jpeg','jpg','gif', 'tiff', 'psd', 'ico'],
```

This will move all PDF files to a directory named *PDF* and all images of mentioned extensions to a directory named *Images*.


#### To add a new file type 
(say .eps) to the *Images* directory, add the new extension to the Images list. So it will change to:

```
[ext]
PDF=['pdf'],
Images=['png','jpeg','jpg','gif', 'tiff', 'psd', 'ico', 'eps'],
```

#### To add a new type of file (new directory)
Say you want to move all the video files along with PDFs and images. You can do that in this way:

```
[ext]
PDF=['pdf'],
Images=['png','jpeg','jpg','gif', 'tiff', 'psd', 'ico', 'eps'],
Videos=['mp4','mkv','avi','3gp'],
```

Now it will arrange all mp4, mkv, avi, 3gp files to the Videos directory.
