Description: # distprob
        
        distprob is a Python library for dealing with distribution calculation and visualization.
        
        Gaussian distribution class - calculating and visualizing a Gaussian distribution.
        Binomial distribution class - calculating and visualizing a Binomial distribution.
        Generic distribution class - calculating and visualizing a probability distribution.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager pip to install distprob.
        
        ```bash

        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        from distprob import Gaussian
        gaussian_one = Gaussian(25, 2)
        gaussian_one.mean
        gaussian_one + gaussian_one
        from distprob import Binomial
        binomial_one = Binomial(, 2)
        binomial_one.mean
        binomial_one + binomial_one
        ```
