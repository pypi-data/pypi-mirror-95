"""
The Python interface to the Trovares xGT graph analytics engine for system
administration functions.

The module represents features intended for use by xGT system admins only.

To use this admin functionality, simply import:

>>> import xgt.admin as xa

Examples
--------

>>> import xgt
>>> import xgt.admin as xa
>>> server = xgt.Connection(userid="user01")
>>> labelset = xa.compute_label_set(server, ['group1', 'group14'])
>>> print("Labelset: {}".format(labelset))
"""

__all__ = [
  'compute_label_set',
  ]

def compute_label_set(server, groupset):
  """
  Compute the set of labels reachable from at least one group in the groupset.
  """
  groups = list(dict.fromkeys(groupset))
  data = server.get_table_frame('xgt__Group_Label').get_data()
  result = dict()
  for row in data:
    if row[0] in groups:
      result[row[1]] = None
  return list(result.keys())
