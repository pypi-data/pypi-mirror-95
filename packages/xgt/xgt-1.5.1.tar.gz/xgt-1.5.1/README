# `xgt`: The Python interface to the Trovares xGT graph analytics engine.

xGT is a high-performance property graph engine designed to support extremely large in-memory graphs, and the `xgt` library is the client-side interface which controls it.

## Documentation

The `xgt` library is self-documenting, and all external methods and classes have docstrings accessible through `help()`.
A formatted version of the same is available online on the Trovares documentation site: [](http://docs.trovares.com/)
