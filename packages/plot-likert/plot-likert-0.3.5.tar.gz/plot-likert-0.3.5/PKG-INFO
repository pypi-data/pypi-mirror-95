Description: Plot Likert
        ===========
        This is a library to visualize results from [Likert-type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale) survey questions in Python, using [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

        Installation
        ------------
        
        ```shell
        pip install plot-likert
        ```
        
        You can also install it directly from Github:
        
        ```shell
        pip install git+https://github.com/nmalkin/plot-likert.git
        ```
        
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        ```python
        # Make sure you have some data
        import pandas as pd
        
        data = pd.DataFrame({'Q1': {0: 'Strongly disagree', 1: 'Agree', ...},
                             'Q2': {0: 'Disagree', 1: 'Strongly agree', ...}})
        
        # Now plot it!
        import plot_likert
        
        plot_likert.plot_likert(data, plot_likert.scales.agree, plot_percentage=True);
        ```
        
        
        Usage and sample figures
        ------------------------
        
        To learn about how to use this library and see more example figures,
        [visit the User Guide, which is a Jupyter notebook](docs/guide.ipynb).

        Background
        ----------
        
        This library was inspired by Jason Bryer's great [`likert` package for R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/likert/) (but it's nowhere near as good).
        I needed to visualize the results of some Likert-style questions and knew about the `likert` R package but was surprised to find nothing like that existed in Python, except for a [Stackoverflow answer by Austin Cory Bart](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41384812). This package builds on that solution and packages it as a library.
        
        I've since discovered that there may be other solutions out there.
        Here are a few to consider:
        - https://github.com/dmardanbeigi/Likert_Scale_Plot_in_Python
        - https://github.com/Oliph/likertScalePlot
        - https://blog.orikami.nl/behind-the-screens-likert-scale-visualization-368557ad72d1
        
        At this stage, it can best be considered a quick-and-dirty hack and lacks a lot of features that would be nice to have.
        (But it's been getting a lot better thanks to the contributions of a number of community members and [FjohÃ¼rs Lykkewe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef7cTuVUiWs)!)
