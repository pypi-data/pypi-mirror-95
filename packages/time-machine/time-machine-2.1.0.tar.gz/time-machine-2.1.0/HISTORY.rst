2.1.0 (2021-02-19)
------------------

* Release now includes wheels for ARM on Linux.

2.0.1 (2021-01-18)
------------------

* Prevent ``ImportError`` on Windows where ``time.tzset()`` is unavailable.

2.0.0 (2021-01-17)
------------------

* Release now includes wheels for Windows and macOS.
* Move internal calculations to use nanoseconds, avoiding a loss of precision.
* After a call to ``move_to()``, the first function call to retrieve the
  current time will return exactly the destination time, copying the behaviour
  of the first call to ``travel()``.
* Add the ability to shift timezone by passing in a ``ZoneInfo`` timezone.
* Remove ``tz_offset`` argument. This was incorrectly copied from
  ``freezegun``. Use the new timezone mocking with ``ZoneInfo`` instead.
* Add pytest plugin and fixture ``time_machine``.
* Work with Windows’ different epoch.

1.3.0 (2020-12-12)
------------------

* Support Python 3.9.
* Move license from ISC to MIT License.

1.2.1 (2020-08-29)
------------------

* Correctly return naive datetimes from ``datetime.utcnow()`` whilst time
  travelling.

  Thanks to Søren Pilgård and Bart Van Loon for the report in
  `Issue #52 <https://github.com/adamchainz/time-machine/issues/52>`__.

1.2.0 (2020-07-08)
------------------

* Add ``move_to()`` method to move to a different time whilst travelling.
  This is based on freezegun's ``move_to()`` method.

1.1.1 (2020-06-22)
------------------

* Move C-level ``clock_gettime()`` and ``clock_gettime_ns()`` checks to
  runtime to allow distribution of macOS wheels.

1.1.0 (2020-06-08)
------------------

* Add ``shift()`` method to move forward in time by a delta whilst travelling.
  This is based on freezegun's ``tick()`` method.

  Thanks to Alex Subbotin for the feature in
  `PR #27 <https://github.com/adamchainz/time-machine/pull/27>`__.

* Fix to work when either ``clock_gettime()`` or ``CLOCK_REALTIME`` is not
  present. This happens on some Unix platforms, for example on macOS with the
  official Python.org installer, which is compiled against macOS 10.9.

  Thanks to Daniel Crowe for the fix in
  `PR #30 <https://github.com/adamchainz/time-machine/pull/30>`__.

1.0.1 (2020-05-29)
------------------

* Fix ``datetime.now()`` behaviour with the ``tz`` argument when not time-travelling.

1.0.0 (2020-05-29)
------------------

* First non-beta release.
* Added support for ``tz_offset`` argument.
* ``tick=True`` will only start time ticking after the first method return that retrieves the current time.
* Added nestability of ``travel()``.
* Support for ``time.time_ns()`` and ``time.clock_gettime_ns()``.

1.0.0b1 (2020-05-04)
--------------------

* First release on PyPI.
