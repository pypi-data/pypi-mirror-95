GAME

GET STARTED

Tchess can save your game in a file, then you can continue that game later. If you run the above command, game will be saved in game.tchess file in current working directory.

But you can customize the file:

\f(CW$ tchess my-game.bin\fR

Also if you played a game and closed that and now you want to continue that game, only give file name as argument:

\f(CW$ tchess my-old-game.bin\fR

(The .bin extension is a example, you can name it whatever you want).

BASICS

when you run the game, you see something like this:

white Turn >>>

The above content will be showed in the terminal. and there is a command input in the bottom. You should pass commands to that for running the game.

Also there is white Turn. this means its turn of white team. if you do something, this will be changed to black Turn.

Also name of Pieces is <team>\-<type>. for example b\-queen (black queen) and w\-king (white king).

The location of cells is accessible with this pattern: <row>\-<column> or <row>.<column>. For example 1\-1 or 6.4.
exit

command exit, exits the program:

>>> exit

Moving the pieces

For moving pieces, you should enter this command:

>>> move <src> to <dst>

for example:

>>> move 2.1 to 4.1

Also you can use mv keyword instead of move:

>>> mv a to b

Also you can don't use to keyword. for example:

>>> mv 2.1 3.1

Also you can see which pieces in the board are allowed to go to the which cells:

>>> s 2.2

The above command s <cell\-address>, will show you the piece in the entered address can go to which cells (The allowed cells will be highlighted with *).
Back

You can revert your moves and back to the previous status.

>>> back

This is useful if you insert a wrong command or move wrong.
Replaying a saved game

If you played a game and it is saved, you can play that!

You should use option \fB\-\-replay\fR:

\f(CW$ tchess --replay my-saved-game.file\fR

Then you can see your game is Replaying!

Also you can set frame speed of Replaying using \fB\-\-replay\-speed\fR option:

\f(CW$ tchess --replay my-saved-game.file --replay-speed=3 # means 3 seound\fR
.br
\f(CW$ tchess --replay my-saved-game.file --replay-speed=0.5\fR

(sort of options is not important).
