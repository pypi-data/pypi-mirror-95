        ## Escaping
        In general, anything you pass as content or an attribute of an Element will be escaped.
        
        The only exceptions are:
        - Style
        - Script
        - Comment
        
        Content passed to these nodes will NOT be escaped (since the escaping rules for them are more relaxed, and you often want/need to put literal '<' or '>' characters in them). You should never pass untrusted user content to these generators. 
        
        In addition, any content passed to MarkSafe will not be escaped.
