Description: # TP-link WiFi Router Controller
        - Based on Selenium.
        - Uses the WebUI as you would normally do.
        - Made due to the lack of any kind of __API__ to interact with any TP-Link Routers.
        
        ## Tested On:
        1. - Hardware: __Archer C1200 v2.0__
           - Firmware Version: __2.0.2 Build 20180118 rel.38979 (EU)__
        
        ## To get started:
        1. Clone the repository.
        2. Create a virtual environment.
        3. Install all the packages from [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt)
        4. Install [JDK-8](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html)
            - Using Chocolatey
            ```CHOCO
            choco install jdk8
            ```
        5. Download [Browsermob-proxy](https://github.com/lightbody/browsermob-proxy/releases/tag/browsermob-proxy-2.1.4).
            - For windows, leave it as default, should work out of the box.
            - Pass it to the instance in code.
            - ```PYTHON
              tplink = TP_Link_Controller(email, password, browsermobproxy_location=r"bin\browsermob-proxy-2.1.4\bin\browsermob-proxy", DEBUG_MODE=True)
              ```
        4. Download the [__Chrome webdriver__](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and place it in [`./bin/`](./bin/) folder for windows.
        5. For __Raspberry Pi__ install .deb packages from [here](https://launchpad.net/~canonical-chromium-builds/+archive/ubuntu/stage/+build/14482955). No need to set bin path, packages will be installed in right directory.
