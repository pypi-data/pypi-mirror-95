# pyls-flake8

A Flake8 plugin for the
[Python Language Server](https://github.com/palantir/python-language-server).

Install this plugin in the same environment as `python-language-server`:

```shell
pip install pyls-flake8
```

pyls-flake8 will read its config from your project's ``setup.cfg``,
``tox.ini`` or ``.flake8`` file if it has one.
