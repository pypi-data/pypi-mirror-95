        ======
        
        Some python (3.8+) stuff for handling files from Project DIVA games.
        
        
        ## pyfarc
        Reads and writes farc archives (FArc/FArC/FARC fully supported).  
        See `docs/pyfarc.md` for usage.
        
        
        ## pyfmh3
        Reads and writes fontmaps for F2nd (BE only), FT and X series games.

        ## Development Info
        License is MIT so do whatever you want, but I'd personally prefer if we avoid forks for now.
        
        Format-specific info is in the relevant docs.
        
        ### Tests
        Run `python -m unittest` from the root directory.
