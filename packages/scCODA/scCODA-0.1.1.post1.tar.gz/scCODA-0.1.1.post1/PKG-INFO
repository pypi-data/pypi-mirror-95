Description: 
        # scCODA - Single-cell differential composition analysis 
        scCODA allows for identification of compositional changes in high-throughput sequencing count data, especially cell compositions from scRNA-seq.
        It also provides a framework for integration of results directly from [scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and other sources.

        The statistical methodology and benchmarking performance are described in:

        ## Installation
        
        Running the package requires a working Python environment (>=3.7).
        
        This package uses the `tensorflow` (`==2.3.2`) and `tensorflow-probability` (`==0.11.0`) packages.
        The GPU versions of these packages have not been tested with scCODA and are thus not recommended.
            
        **To install scCODA via pip, call**:
        
            pip install sccoda
        
        **To install scCODA from source**:
        
        - Navigate to the directory you want scCODA in
        - Clone the repository from Github (https://github.com/theislab/scCODA):
        
            `git clone https://github.com/theislab/scCODA`
        
        - Navigate to the root directory of scCODA:
        
            `cd scCODA`
        
        - Install dependencies::
        
            `pip install -r requirements.txt`
        
        - Install the package:
        
            `python setup.py install`
        
        **Import scCODA in a Python session via**:
        
            import sccoda
