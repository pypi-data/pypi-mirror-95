"""Minecraft Runner - A python script for working with servers.

This package is designed to provide the functionality necessary to more easily
interact with Minecraft servers that are running in containers. It essentially
functions as a wrapper around much more complex `podman` or `docker` commands,
with some awareness of how the containers should be built and structured,
because it is codeveloped and colocated with those container images.

This project is wholely unaffiliated with Microsoft, Mojang, Minecraft,
FeedTheBeast, SpigotMC, Paper, or Minecraft server related projects. It is an
independent release to make management of local servers simpler, across a wide
variety of modpacks.
