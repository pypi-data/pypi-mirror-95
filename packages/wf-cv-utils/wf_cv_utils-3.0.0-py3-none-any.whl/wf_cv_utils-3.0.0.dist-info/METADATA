# cv_utils

Miscellaneous utilities for working with camera data:

* Utilities for working with images and videos (many of which use OpenCV "under the hood")

* Functions which support basic visualization of image and object points

* Functions which support camera calibration using OpenCV and/or COLMAP


## Task list

* Add option to `project_points()` to include points that are projected inside the frame with distortion but just outside the frame without
* Integrate (Docker-based?) version of OpenCV which supports proprietary codecs (primarily `mp4`)
* Consider implementing additional objects/classes (e.g., `Camera`)
* Move Wildflower-specific functionality into separate package
* Add additional functions so we can eliminate OpenCV as dependency for `wf-process-pose_data`, `wf-video-io`, `wf-camera-calibration`, etc.
* Implement more performant replacement for `cv.triangulatePoints()`
* Augment drawing functions so they can handle multiple objects, `Nan` values, etc.
* Get ride of unused/buggy functions in `core`
* Clean up color conversion helper functions (use OpenCV functions?)
* Move 3D projection code into its own submodule
* Convert drawing functions in `core` to object-oriented Matplotlib interface?
* Convert drawing functions in `core` to OpenCV drawing API?
* Fix comments in `generate_camera_pose()` (currently describes yaw inaccurately)
* Clean up handling of coordinates (shouldn't OpenCV accept numpy arrays?)
* Clean up handling of large integer coordinates
