Description: # Pi Picture Frame
        
        A picture frame script primarily developed for Raspberry
        Pi but can also run under Linux.
        (Some extra work is needed to run under Windows.)
        
        It uses [pi3d](https://pi3d.github.io/) to render the pictures.
        The actual OpenGL code is from [pi3d_demos](https://github.com/pi3d/pi3d_demos).
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev  # Need for numpy
        sudo pip3 install pipictureframe
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Run
        
        `pi-picture-frame -h`
        
        to getp a comprehensive list of options.
         
         ## Features
         
         - Smooth and configurable transitions from picture to 
         picture incl. pre-loading of next picture to avoid
         artifacts during transition
         - Background blurring
         - Image resizing
         - Configurable display of text (e.g. date, file name, etc.)
         - Caching of all picture files in db.
         - Filtering of image list
         
         ### Filters
         
         Currently only a filter based on image ratings is
         implemented. If additonal filters are needed, let me
         know.
