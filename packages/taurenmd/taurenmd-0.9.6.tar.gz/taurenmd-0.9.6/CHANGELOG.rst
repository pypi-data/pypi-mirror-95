Versioning
==========

This project follows strictly `Semantic Versioning 2.0 <https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-200>`_ for version control. 

Upon release of version 1.0.0, all additions to the ``master`` branch are done by PR followed by its respective version increment and release on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/taurenmd/>`_.

Upon version 0.8, and before version 1, SV2 major version increments are reflected in the *minor* version number, and minor and patch increments are reflected together in the *patch* version number. Everything else follows SV2 rules, in this way users can track backwards incompatibilities if they happen.
