"""
Template for command-line clients.

This file provides a template structure to build new command line clients.

Copy this file to a new file named for your command line, for example:

    >>> cp _cli_template.py cli_NAME.py

Where ``NAME`` is the name of your new client, do not use CAPS.

In your new client, replace this docstring by a proper description
of the operations performed by your client. Keep clients as simple as possible.
Two simple clients are better than a complex one. You can/should read
through the documentation of other clients for examples.

Code blocks are mandatory by default unless stated as optional.
Also, functions and variable names in the main namespace should be kept
not to break functionality with the program infrastructure.

For those optional code blocks, just delete or comment out those options
needed or not for your purpose.

Please refer to our library documentation to see all available functions.
Feel free to implement you own functions in their respective lib*.py modules.

Once it is finished, add your client to the cli.py file, instructions are
provided there as comments throughout the file.

Also, add an entry point to the setup.py file, instructions are provided
there as well, look for the 'entry_points' argument.

Test driven development is a must. You should write the test cases for
your client and newly developed functions. Visit the tests/test_clis.py,
instructions are provided by comments throughout the script. Add additional
tests on the test_lib* corresponding file if you have developed new functions.

Finally, go the ``docs/reference`` folder. There is a ``cli_template.xxx``
template file there, just copy it to a ``cli_name.rst`` file and modify
it accordingly: 1) give a title, 2) change ``NAME`` for the name of your
client. Add that file reference to the toctree in the
``docs/reference/clients.rst`` file.

You can use ``tox`` during your development to confirm code style,
documentation build, and tests. It is useful if the tests for these
three tox environments pass before you Pull Request:

    >>> tox -e check
    >>> tox -e docs
    >>> tox -e py37  # or py36 depending
