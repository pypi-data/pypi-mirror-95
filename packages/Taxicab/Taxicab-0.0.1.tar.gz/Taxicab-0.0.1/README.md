## Taxicab
When routing between two points of longitude and latitude, the built in routing functionality in OSMnx will find the nearest network nodes and route between those. This assumption is fine, and works for many applications but when you need routing with a little more accuracy you'll want to consider using Taxicab. Below are a few examples which highlight Taxicab usecases:

When the nearest nodes are not that close

When routing along a single edge:

When routing along short routes:

## Installation
The easiest way to use Taxicab is probably via a PyPi install:
```sh
pip install taxicab
```
You can also install directly from this repo:
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/nathanrooy/taxicab
```
