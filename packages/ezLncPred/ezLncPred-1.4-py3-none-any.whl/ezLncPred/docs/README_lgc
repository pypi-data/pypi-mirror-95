# Sequence Name: name of transcript
# ORF Length: length of the longest ORF
# GC Content: GC content of the longest ORF
# Coding Potential Score: coding potential score for a transcript, which is protein-coding RNA if greater than 0 or ncRNA if smaller than 0. '0' indicates that mRNA probability equals lncRNA probability. Also, if the ORF length is shorter than 100nt, '0' is output.
# pc: ORF probability for coding sequence
# pnc: ORF probability for non-coding sequence
# fc: Stop-codon probability for coding sequence
# fnc: Stop-codon probability for non-coding sequence
# Coding Label: 'Coding' represents mRNA and 'Non-coding' represents ncRNA
