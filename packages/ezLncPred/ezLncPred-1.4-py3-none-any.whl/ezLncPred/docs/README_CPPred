1) Introduction

CPPred is a coding potential prediction tool, which is based on SVM to distinguish
ncRNAs from coding RNAs using sequence features, such as ORF length, ORF coverage, 
ORF integrity, Fickett score, Hexamer score, PI, Gravy, Instability index and 
CTD-encoded features.

2) Usage
	-h --help		show this help message and exit
	
	-p --species	{Human,Integrated}
					the model of the species to choose (Human,Integrated).
	
**example**
	ezLncPred CPPred -h
	ezLncPred -i example.fa -o results CPPred
	ezLncPred -i example.fa -o results CPPred -p Integrated
