The Nanocluster Interpolation Scheme Program (NISP) is designed to perform an interpolation scheme that can give an idea of icosahedral, decahedral, and octahedral clusters that can be formed with a given number of atoms. 

This scheme is based on the work by Garden *et al.* as described in "Reassignment of ‘magic numbers’ for Au clusters of decahedral and FCC structural motifs",

See https://doi.org/10.1039/C7NR09440J for more information on this scheme.

**If you are new to NISP, it is recommended try it out by running NISP live on our interactive Jupyter+Binder page before you download it. On Jupyter+Binder, you can play around with NISP on the web. You do not need to install anything to try NISP out on Jupyter+Binder.** 

**Click the Binder button below to try NISP out on the web! (The Binder page may load quickly or may take 1 or 2 minutes to load)**

All the information about this program is found online at [nisp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://nisp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). It is recommended to read the installation page before using the algorithm ([nisp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation.html](https://nisp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation.html)). Note that you can install NISP through ``pip3`` and ``conda``. See the [installation instructions](https://nisp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation.html) on how to do this.
