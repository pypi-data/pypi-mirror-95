===================
SQLAlchemy 2 Stubs
===================

These are the PEP-484 typing stubs for SQLAlchemy 1.4 and
SQLAlchemy 2.0, as well as a mypy extension.

This package will be integrated within SQLAlchemy 2 itself
as inline type annotations for SQLAlchemy 2.0's release.


For SQLAlchemy 1.4, the annotations are published here
as separate stubs so that users who are relying upon
the "sqlalchemy-stubs" package published by Dropbox can
continue to do so.  This package necessarily replaces
sqlalchemy-stubs entirely, and will be in development
throughout the 1.4 SQLAlchemy series.

This project is **under consruction** right now and initial
releases will be in the coming weeks of 2021.
