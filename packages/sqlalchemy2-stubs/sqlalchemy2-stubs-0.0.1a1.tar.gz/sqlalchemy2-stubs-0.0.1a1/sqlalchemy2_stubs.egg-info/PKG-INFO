Description: ===================
        SQLAlchemy 2 Stubs
        ===================
        
        These are the PEP-484 typing stubs for SQLAlchemy 1.4 and
        SQLAlchemy 2.0, as well as a mypy extension.
        
        This package will be integrated within SQLAlchemy 2 itself
        as inline type annotations for SQLAlchemy 2.0's release.
        
        
        For SQLAlchemy 1.4, the annotations are published here
        as separate stubs so that users who are relying upon
        the "sqlalchemy-stubs" package published by Dropbox can
        continue to do so.  This package necessarily replaces
        sqlalchemy-stubs entirely, and will be in development
        throughout the 1.4 SQLAlchemy series.
        
        This project is **under consruction** right now and initial
        releases will be in the coming weeks of 2021.
