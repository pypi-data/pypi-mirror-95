Description: # lightcards
        Terminal flashcards from Markdown.
        
        ## Installation
        Lightcards is only tested and maintained on Linux. Support for other Unix-like operating systems such as MacOS and the various BSDs is likely, although untested. Windows support may be possible with [windows-curses](https://pypi.org/project/windows-curses/) or the like, however much of the program makes the assumption that there is a Unix-like file hierarchy, which may break on Windows. Nontrivial patches will not be accepted to improve Windows support, although may be for MacOS or BSD.
        
        Lightcards requires Python 3.9
        
        ### From PyPI
        ```
        pip install lightcards
        ```
        
        ### From Git
        #### Main branch (stable)

        ## Usage
        See `lightcards --help` or `man lightcards` for usage information.
        
        ## Input file
        `contrib/example.md` is an example input file. Lightcards takes all of the tables from a valid Markdown or HTML file. Each row is a card, and the two columns are the front and back.
        
        ## Configuration
        Copy the config file at `/etc/lightcards/config.py` to `~/.config/lightcards/config.py` or `~/${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/lightcards/config.py` and edit.
