Description: # Flask-Bcrypt
        
        Flask-Bcrypt is a Flask extension that provides bcrypt hashing utilities for
        your application.
        
        Due to the recent increased prevalence of powerful hardware, such as modern
        GPUs, hashes have become increasingly easy to crack. A proactive solution to
        this is to use a hash that was designed to be "de-optimized". Bcrypt is such
        a hashing facility; unlike hashing algorithms such as MD5 and SHA1, which are
        optimized for speed, bcrypt is intentionally structured to be slow.
        
        For sensitive data that must be protected, such as passwords, bcrypt is an
        advisable choice.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install using pip:
        
        ```bash
        pip install flask-bcrypt
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        To use the extension simply import the class wrapper and pass the Flask app
        object back to here. Do so like this:
        
        ```python
        from flask import Flask
        from flask_bcrypt import Bcrypt
        
        app = Flask(__name__)
        bcrypt = Bcrypt(app)
        ```
        
        Two primary hashing methods are now exposed by way of the bcrypt object. Use
        them like so:
        
        ```python
        pw_hash = bcrypt.generate_password_hash('hunter2')
        bcrypt.check_password_hash(pw_hash, 'hunter2') # returns True
        ```
