A high level API for internationalizing Python libraries and applications.

The ``flufl.i18n`` library provides a convenient API for managing translation
contexts in Python applications.  It provides facilities not only for
single-context applications like command line scripts, but also more
sophisticated management of multiple-context applications such as Internet
servers.
