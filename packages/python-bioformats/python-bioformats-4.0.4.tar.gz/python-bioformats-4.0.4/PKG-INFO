Description: Python-bioformats is a Python wrapper for Bio-Formats, a standalone Java library for reading
            and writing life sciences image file formats. Bio-Formats is capable of parsing both pixels and metadata for a
            large number of formats, as well as writing to several formats. Python-bioformats uses the python-javabridge to
            start a Java virtual machine from Python and interact with it. Python-bioformats was developed for and is used by
            the cell image analysis software CellProfiler (cellprofiler.org).
