features:
  - |
    For baremetal operations on DHCPv6-stateful networks multiple IPv6
    addresses can now be allocated for neutron ports created for provisioning,
    cleaning, rescue or inspection. The new parameter
    ``[neutron]/dhcpv6_stateful_address_count`` controls the number of addresses
    to allocate (Default: 4).
fixes:
  - |
    The 'no address available' problem seen when network booting on
    DHCPv6-stateful networks is fixed with the support for allocating multiple
    IPv6 addresses. See `bug: 1861032
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1861032>`_.
