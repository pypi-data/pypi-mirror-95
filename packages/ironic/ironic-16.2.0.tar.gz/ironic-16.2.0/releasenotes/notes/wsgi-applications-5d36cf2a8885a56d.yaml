upgrade:
  - A new WSGI application script ``ironic-api-wsgi`` is now available.
    It is auto-generated by ``pbr`` and provides the ability to serve
    the bare metal API using a WSGI server (for example Nginx and uWSGI or
    Apache with mod_wsgi).
deprecations:
  - Using ``ironic/api/app.wsgi`` script is deprecated and it will be removed
    in Rocky release.
    Please switch to automatically generated ``ironic-api-wsgi`` script
    instead.
