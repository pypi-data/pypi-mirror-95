    The ``redfish_system_id`` property of redfish hardware type has been made
    optional. If not specified in ``driver_info``, and the target BMC manages
    a single ComputerSystem, ironic will assume that system. Otherwise, ironic
    will fail requiring explicit ``redfish_system_id`` specification in
    ``driver_info``.
