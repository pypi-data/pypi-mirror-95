    The Ironic Developers are proud to announce the release of Ironic 15.0!

    This release contains a number of changes that have been sought by
    operators and users of Ironic for some time, including support for UEFI
    booting a software RAID system, improved Ironic/Ironic Python Agent
    security, multi-tenancy constructs, a hardware retirement mechanism,
    stateful DHCPv6, and numerous fixes.

    We sincerely hope you enjoy!
