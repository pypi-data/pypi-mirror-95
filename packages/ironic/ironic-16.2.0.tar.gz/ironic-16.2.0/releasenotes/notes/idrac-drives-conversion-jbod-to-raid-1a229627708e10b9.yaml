    When using the PERC H730P RAID controller, physical
    disks must be put into RAID mode prior to creating a
    virtual disk that includes them.  If one or more
    physical disks are in JBOD/Non-RAID mode when creating
    a virtual disk from them, then the iDRAC will return
    an error.  This patch ensures that the physical disks
    being included in a virtual disk are converted to RAID
    mode prior to creating the virtual disk.
