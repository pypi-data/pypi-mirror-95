upgrade:
  - |
    The default value of ``[deploy]/default_boot_option`` is changed from
    ``netboot`` to ``local``.
  - Due to the default boot option change, partition images without ``grub2``
    will be unable to be deployed without the ``boot_option`` for the node
    to be explicitly set to ``netboot``.
