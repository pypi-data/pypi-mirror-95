upgrade:
  - |
    The deprecated ``iscsi`` deploy interface is no longer enabled by default,
    set ``enabled_deploy_interfaces`` to override. It is also no longer
    the first in the list of deploy interface priorities, so it has to be
    requested explicitly if the ``direct`` deploy is also enabled.
  - |
    Since the ``direct`` deploy interface is now used by default, you need to
    configure ``[deploy]http_url`` and ``[deploy]http_root`` to point at a
    local HTTP server or configure access to Swift.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``iscsi`` deploy interface is now deprecated, ``direct`` or ``ansible``
    deploy should be used instead. We expected the complete removal of the
    ``iscsi`` deploy code to happen in the "X" release.
