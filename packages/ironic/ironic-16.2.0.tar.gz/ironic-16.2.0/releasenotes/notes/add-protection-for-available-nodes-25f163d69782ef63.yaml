features:
  - Adds option ``allow_deleting_available_nodes`` to control whether nodes in
    state ``available`` should be deletable (which is and stays the default).
    Setting this option to ``False`` will remove ``available`` from the list of
    states in which nodes can be deleted from ironic. It hence provides
    protection against accidental removal of nodes which are ready for
    allocation (and is meant as a safeguard for the operational effort to
    bring nodes into this state). For backwards compatibility reasons, the
    default value for this option is ``True``. The other states in which nodes
    can be deleted from ironic (``manageable``, ``enroll``, and ``adoptfail``)
    remain unchanged. This option can be changed without service restart.
