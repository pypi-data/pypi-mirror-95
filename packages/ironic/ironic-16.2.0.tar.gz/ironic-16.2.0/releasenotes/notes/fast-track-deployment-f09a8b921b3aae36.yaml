    Adds a new feature called `fast-track` which allows an operator to
    optionally configure the Bare Metal API Service and the Bare Metal
    conductor service to permit lookup and heartbeat for nodes that are
    in the process of being enrolled and created.

    These nodes can be left online, from a process such as discovery.
    If ironic-python-agent has communicated with the Bare Metal Service
    API endpoint with-in the last `300` seconds, then setup steps that
    are normally involved with preparing to launch a ramdisk on the node,
    are skipped along with power operations to enable a baremetal node to
    undergo discovery through to deployment with a single power cycle.
    Fast track functionality may be enabled through the ``[deploy]fast_track``
    option.
