features:
  - |
    Adds support of "agent token" which serves as a mechanism to secure
    the normally unauthenticated API endpoints in ironic which are used in
    the mechanics of baremetal provisioning. This feature is optional, however
    operators may require this feature by changing the
    ``[DEFAULT]require_agent_token`` setting to ``True``.
upgrades:
  - |
    In order to use the new Agent Token support, all ramdisk settings should
    be updated for all nodes in ironic. If token use is required by ironic's
    configuration, and the ramdisks have not been updated, then all
    deployment, cleaning, and rescue operations will fail until the version of
    the ironic-python-agent ramdisk has been updated.
issues:
  - |
    The ``ansible`` deployment interface does not support use of an
    ``agent token`` at this time.
