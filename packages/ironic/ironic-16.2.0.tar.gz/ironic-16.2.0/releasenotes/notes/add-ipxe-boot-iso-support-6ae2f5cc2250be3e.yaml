features:

    Adds functionality to the ``ipxe`` boot interface to support use of an
    ``instance_info\boot_iso`` value with the ``ramdisk`` deployment interface.
other:
  - |
    Support for iPXE booting a ISO medium will only work if the ramdisk loaded
    by the bootloader contains all artifacts required for the booting operating
    system to load. This is a limitation of iPXE and x86 systems architecture,
    as the memory allocated for the rest of the ISO disk image in memory is
    freed by the booting kernel.
