    Fixes an issue with fasttrack where a recent security related change to
    prevent the ``agent_url`` field from being updated in a node, to
    functionally prevent fast_track from succeeding as the node would fail
    with an exception indicating the ``agent_url`` could not be found.
    The required ``agent_url`` value is now preserved when the fast track
    feature is enabled as the running ramdisk is not shut down.
