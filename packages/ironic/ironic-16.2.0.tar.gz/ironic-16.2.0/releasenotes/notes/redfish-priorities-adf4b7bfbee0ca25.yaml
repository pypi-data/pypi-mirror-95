    The ``redfish-virtual-media`` boot interface is now the last in the list of
    priorities from the ``redfish`` hardware type. This means that new nodes
    will be created with ``ipxe`` or ``pxe`` boot if they are enabled. The
    reason for this change is limited support for pure Redfish virtual media
    from hardware vendors.

    To use virtual media with Redfish, please provide an explicit
    ``boot_interface`` parameter when creating nodes. If you enable only the
    ``redfish`` hardware type, you can also set the ``default_boot_interface``
    configuration option to ``redfish-virtual-media``.
