    Adds a ``traits`` field to the node resource, which will be used by the
    Compute service to define which nodes may match a Compute flavor using
    qualitative attributes.

    The following new endpoints have been added to the Bare Metal REST API in
    version 1.37:

    * ``GET /v1/nodes/<node identifier>/traits`` lists the traits for a node.
    * ``PUT /v1/nodes/<node identifier>/traits`` sets all traits for a node.
    * ``PUT /v1/nodes/<node identifier>/traits/<trait>`` adds a trait to a
      node.
    * ``DELETE /v1/nodes/<node identifier>/traits`` removes all traits from a
      node.
    * ``DELETE /v1/nodes/<node identifier>/traits/<trait>`` removes a trait
      from a node.

    A node's traits are also included in the following node query and list
    responses:

    * ``GET /v1/nodes/<node identifier>``
    * ``GET /v1/nodes/detail``
    * ``GET /v1/nodes?fields=traits``

    Traits cannot be specified on node creation, nor can they be updated via a
    ``PATCH`` request on the node.
