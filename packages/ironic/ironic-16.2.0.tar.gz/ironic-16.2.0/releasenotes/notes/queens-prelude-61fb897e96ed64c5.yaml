    The 10.1.0 (Queens) release includes many new features and bug fixes.

    Please review the "Upgrade Notes" sections (for 9.2.0, 10.0.0 and 10.1.0)
    which describe the required actions to upgrade your installation from
    9.1.x (Pike) to 10.1.0 (Queens).

    A few major changes since 9.1.x (Pike) are worth mentioning:

    - New `traits API
      <https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/baremetal/#node-traits-nodes>`_.

    - New ``ansible`` deploy interface that allows greater customization of
      the provisioning process.

    - Support for rescuing and unrescuing nodes.

    - Support for `routed networks
      <https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/latest/admin/config-routed-networks>`_
      when using the ``flat`` network interface.

    - New ``xclarity`` hardware type for managing Lenovo server hardware.

    Finally, this release deprecates classic drivers in favor of hardware
    types. Please check `the migration guide
    <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/upgrade-to-hardware-types.html>`_
    for information on which hardware types and interfaces to enable before
    upgrade and how to update the nodes. The ``ironic-dbsync
    online_data_migrations`` command will handle the migration, if all
    required hardware types and interfaces are enabled before the upgrade.
