upgrade:
  - |
    The ``swift/endpoint_type`` configuration option is now removed.
    python-swiftclient 3.2.0 (Ocata) and above removed support for the native
    URL type used by radosgw. Since using a ``swift/endpoint_type`` value of
    ``radosgw`` would fail anyway, it is removed. Deployers must now configure
    ceph with ``rgw swift account in url = True``. This must be set before
    upgrading to this release.
