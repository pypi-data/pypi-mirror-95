features:
  - |
    The ``pxe`` and ``ipxe`` boot interfaces, as well as all in-tree network
    interfaces, now support managing in-band inspection boot.
upgrade:
  - |
    For the managed in-band inspection to work, make sure that the Bare Metal
    Introspection endpoint (either in the service catalog or in the
    ``[inspector]endpoint_override`` configuration option) is not set to
    localhost. Alternatively, set the ``[inspector]callback_endpoint_override``
    option to a value with a real IP address.
