    Fixes a race condition in the hash ring implementation that could cause
    an internal server error on any request. See `story 2003966
    <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2003966>`_ for details.

    The ``hash_ring_reset_interval`` configuration option was changed from 180
    to 15 seconds. Previously, this option was essentially ignored on the API
    side, becase the hash ring was reset on each API access. The lower value
    minimizes the probability of a request routed to a wrong conductor when the
    ring needs rebalancing.
