    Change the default for ``use_ipmitool_retries`` to ``False`` so that
    Ironic will do the retries by default.  This is needed for certain BMCs
    that don't support the Cipher Suites command and ipmitool retries take an
    excessively long time.  See `story 2007632
    <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2007632>`_ for additional
    information.
