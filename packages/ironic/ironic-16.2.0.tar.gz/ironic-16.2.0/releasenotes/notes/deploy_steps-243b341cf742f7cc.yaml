    The `framework for deployment steps
    <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/ironic-specs/specs/approved/deployment-steps-framework.html>`_
    is in place. All in-tree drivers (DeployInterfaces) have one (big) deploy
    step; the conductor executes this step when deploying a node.

    Starting with the Bare Metal REST API version 1.44, the current deploy
    step (if any) being executed is available in a node's ``deploy_step``
    field in the responses for the following queries:

    * ``GET /v1/nodes/<node identifier>``
    * ``GET /v1/nodes/detail``
    * ``GET /v1/nodes?fields=deploy_step,...``
deprecations:
  - |
    All drivers must implement their deployment process using `deploy steps`.
    Out-of-tree drivers without deploy steps will be supported until the
    Stein release.
