    ``ironic-dbsync online_data_migrations`` will migrate any port's and
    port group's extra['vif_port_id'] value to their
    internal_info['tenant_vif_port_id'].
    For API versions >= 1.28, the ability to attach/detach the VIF via
    the port's or port group's extra['vif_port_id'] will not be supported
    starting with the Stein release.

    Any out-of-tree network interface implementations that had a different
    behavior in support of attach/detach VIFs via the port or port group's
    extra['vif_port_id'] must be updated appropriately.
