    The ``deploy`` deploy step of the ``iscsi`` deploy interface has been
    split into three deploy steps:

    * ``deploy`` itself (priority 100) boots the deploy ramdisk

    * ``write_image`` (priority 80) writes the image to the disk exposed
      via iSCSI.

    * ``prepare_instance_boot`` (priority 60) prepares the boot device and
      writes the bootloader (if needed).

    Priorities 81 to 99 to be used for in-band deploy steps that run before
    the image is written. Priorities 61 to 79 can be used for in-band deploy
    steps that modify the written image before the bootloader is installed.

    split into two deploy steps:

    * ``deploy`` itself (priority 100) boots the deploy ramdisk

    * ``write_image`` (priority 80) writes the image to the disk and configures
      the bootloader.

    Priorities 81 to 99 to be used for in-band deploy steps that run before
    the image is written.
