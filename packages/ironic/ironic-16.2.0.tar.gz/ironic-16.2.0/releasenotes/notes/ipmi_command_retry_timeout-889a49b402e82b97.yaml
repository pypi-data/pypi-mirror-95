    Calculating the ipmitool ``-N`` and ``-R`` arguments from the configuration
    options ``[ipmi]command_retry_timeout`` and ``[ipmi]min_command_interval``
    now takes into account the 1 second interval increment that ipmitool adds
    on each retry event.

    Failure-path ipmitool run duration will now be just less than
    ``command_retry_timeout`` instead of much longer.
