    Adds support to retrieve the information of conductors known
    by ironic:

    * a new endpoint ``GET /v1/conductors`` for listing conductor resources.
    * a new endpoint ``GET /v1/conductors/{hostname}`` for showing a
      conductor resource.

    Adds a read-only ``conductor`` field to the Node, which represents the
    conductor currently servicing a node, and can be retrieved from following
    node endpoints:

    * ``GET /v1/nodes?detail=true`` or ``GET /v1/nodes/detail``
    * ``GET /v1/nodes/<node_ident>``
    * ``POST /v1/nodes``
    * ``PATCH /v1/nodes/<node_ident>``
