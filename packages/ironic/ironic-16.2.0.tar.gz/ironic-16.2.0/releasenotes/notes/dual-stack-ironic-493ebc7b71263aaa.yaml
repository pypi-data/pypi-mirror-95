features:
  - |
    Adds functionality with neutron integration to support dual-stack
    (IPv4 and IPv6 environment configurations). This enables ironic to
    look up the attached port(s) and supply DHCP options in alignment
    with the protocol version allocated on the port.
upgrade:
  - |
    The ``[pxe]ip_version`` setting may no longer be required depending on
    neutron integration.
  - |
    Operators that used the ``[DEFAULT]my_ip`` setting with an IPv6 address
    may wish to explore migrating to the ``[DEFAULT]my_ipv6`` setting. Setting
    both values enables the appropriate IP addresses based on protocol version
    for PXE/iPXE.
