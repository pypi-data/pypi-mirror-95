    Provides a workaround for hardware that does not support persistent boot
    device setting with the ``redfish`` hardware type. When such situation is
    detected, ironic will fall back to one-time boot device setting, restoring
    it on every reboot.
issues:
  - |
    Some redfish-enabled hardware is known not to support persistent boot
    device setting that is used by the Bare Metal service for deployed
    instances. The ``redfish`` hardware type tries to work around this problem,
    but rebooting such an instance in-band may cause it to boot incorrectly.
    A predictable boot order should be configured in the node's boot firmware
    to avoid issues and at least metadata cleaning must be enabled.
