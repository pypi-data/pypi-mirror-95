    The ``deploy`` deploy step of the ``direct`` deploy interface has been
    split into three deploy steps:

    * ``deploy`` itself (priority 100) boots the deploy ramdisk

    * ``write_image`` (priority 80) downloads the user image from inside
      the ramdisk and writes it to the disk.

    * ``prepare_instance_boot`` (priority 60) prepares the boot device and
      writes the bootloader (if needed).

    Priorities 81 to 99 to be used for in-band deploy steps that run before
    the image is written. Priorities 61 to 79 can be used for in-band deploy
    steps that modify the written image before the bootloader is installed.
