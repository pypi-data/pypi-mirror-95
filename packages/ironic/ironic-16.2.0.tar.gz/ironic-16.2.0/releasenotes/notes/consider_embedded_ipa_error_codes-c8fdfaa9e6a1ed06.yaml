    Fixes an issue in the ``ironic-python-agent`` client code
    where a command exception may not be captured in the interaction
    with the agent rest API. The client code would return the resulting
    error message and a static error code. We now look with-in the error
    to detect if the error may be a compatability error to raise the
    appropriate exception for fallback logic to engage.
