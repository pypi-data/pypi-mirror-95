    It's now possible to force booting for in-band inspection to be managed
    by ironic by setting the new ``[inspector]require_managed_boot`` option
    to ``True``. In-band inspection will fail if the node's driver does not
    support managing boot for it.

    Boot and network interface implementations can now manage boot for in-band
    inspection by implementing the new methods:

    * ``BootInterface.validate_inspection``
    * ``NetworkInterface.validate_inspection``
    * ``NetworkInterface.add_inspection_network``
    * ``NetworkInterface.remove_inspection_network``

    Previously only ironic-inspector itself could manage boot for it. This
    change opens a way for non-PXE implementations of in-band inspection.
