    Adds ``external`` storage interface which is short for
    "externally managed". This adds logic to allow the Bare
    Metal service to identify when a BFV scenario is being
    requested based upon the configuration set for
    ``volume targets``.

    The user must create the entry, and no syncronizaiton
    with a Block Storage service will occur.
    `Documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/boot-from-volume.html#use-without-cinder>`_
    has been updated to reflect how to use this interface.
