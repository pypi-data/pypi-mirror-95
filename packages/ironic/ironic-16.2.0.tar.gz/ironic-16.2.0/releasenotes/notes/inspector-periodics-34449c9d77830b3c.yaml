    The periodic tasks for the ``inspector`` inspect interface are no longer
    disabled if the ``[inspector]enabled`` option is not set to ``True``.
    The help string of this option claims that it does not apply to hardware
    types. In any case, the periodic tasks are only run if any enabled
    classic driver or hardware interface requires them.
