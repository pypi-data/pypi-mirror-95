    Better handles the case when an operator attempts to perform an upgrade
    from a release older than Pike, directly to a release newer than Pike,
    skipping one or more releases in between (i.e. a "skip version upgrade").
    Instead of crashing, the operator will be informed that
    upgrading from a version older than the previous release is not supported
    (skip version upgrades) and that (as of Pike) all database migrations need
    to be performed using the previous releases for a fast-forward upgrade.
