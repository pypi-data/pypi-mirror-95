    Fixes ``idrac-wsman`` RAID ``create_configuration`` clean step,
    ``apply_configuration`` deploy step and ``delete_configuration`` clean and
    deploy step to fail correctly in case of error when checking completed
    jobs. Before the fix when RAID job failed, then node cleaning or deploying
    failed with timeout instead of actual error in clean or deploy step.
