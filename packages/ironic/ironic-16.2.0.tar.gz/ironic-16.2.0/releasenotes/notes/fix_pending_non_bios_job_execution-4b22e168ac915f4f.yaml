    Fixes a bug in the ``idrac`` hardware type where executing
    the ``clear_job_queue`` clean step, pending non-BIOS config jobs
    (E.g. create/delete virtual disk) were not being deleted before
    job execution.

    See bug `2006580 <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2006580>`_
    for details.
