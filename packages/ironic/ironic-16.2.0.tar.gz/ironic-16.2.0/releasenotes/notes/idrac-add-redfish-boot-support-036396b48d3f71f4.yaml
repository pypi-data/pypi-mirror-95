    Adds ``idrac`` hardware type support of a virtual media boot
    interface implementation that utilizes the Redfish out-of-band (OOB)
    management protocol and is compatible with the integrated Dell
    Remote Access Controller (iDRAC) baseboard management controller
    (BMC). It is named ``idrac-redfish-virtual-media``.

    The ``idrac`` hardware type declares support for that new interface
    implementation, in addition to all boot interface implementations it
    has been supporting. The highest priority boot interfaces remain the
    same. It now supports the following boot interface implementations,
    listed in priority order from highest to lowest: ``ipxe``, ``pxe``,
    and ``idrac-redfish-virtual-media``.

    To use the new boot interface, install the ``sushy-oem-idrac``
    Python package.
