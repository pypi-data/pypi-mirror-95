    A future release will change the default value of
    ``[deploy]/default_boot_mode`` from "bios" to "uefi". It is recommended to
    set an explicit value for this option. For hardware types which don't
    support setting boot mode, a future release will assume boot mode is set
    to UEFI if no boot mode is set to node's capabilities. It is also
    recommended to set ``boot_mode`` into ``properties/capabilities``
    of a node.
