deprecations:
  - |
    The ``oneview`` hardware type, as well as the supporting
    driver interfaces have been deprecated and are scheduled to be removed
    from ironic in the Stein development cycle. This is due to the lack of
    operational Third Party testing to help ensure that the support for
    Oneview is functional.
    Oneview Third Party CI was shutdown just prior to the start of the Rocky
    development cycle, and at the time of this deprecation the Ironic
    community has no indication that testing will be restablished.
    Should testing be restablished, this deprecation shall be rescinded.
