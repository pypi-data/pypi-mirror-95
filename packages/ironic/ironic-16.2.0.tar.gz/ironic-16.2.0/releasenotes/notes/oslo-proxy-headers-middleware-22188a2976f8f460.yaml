    Ironic API service now supports HTTP proxy headers parsing
    with the help of oslo.middleware package, enabled via new option
    ``[oslo_middleware]/enable_proxy_headers_parsing`` (``False`` by default).

    This enables more complex setups of Ironic API service, for example when
    the same service instance serves both internal and public API endpoints
    via separate proxies.

    When proxy headers parsing is enabled, the value of
    ``[api]/public_endpoint`` option is ignored.
