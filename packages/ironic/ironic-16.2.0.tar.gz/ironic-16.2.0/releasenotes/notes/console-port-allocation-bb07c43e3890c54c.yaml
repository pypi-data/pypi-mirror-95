    Adds a new configuration option ``[console]port_range``, which specifies
    the range of ports can be consumed for the IPMI serial console. The
    default value is ``None`` for backwards compatibility. If the
    ``ipmi_terminal_port`` is not specified in the driver information for a
    node, a free port will be allocated from the configured port range for
    further use.
