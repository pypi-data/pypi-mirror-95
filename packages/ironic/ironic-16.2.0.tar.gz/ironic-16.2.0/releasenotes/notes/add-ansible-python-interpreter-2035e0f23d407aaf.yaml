features:
  - Adds option ``[ansible]default_python_interpreter`` to choose
    the python interpreter that ansible uses on managed machines.
    By default, ansible uses ``/usr/bin/python`` as interpreter, making the
    assumption that path is always present on remote managed systems.
    This might not be always the case, for example in custom build
    images or Python 3 native distributions.
    With this option the operator has the ability to set the absolute
    path of the python interpreter on the remote machines, for example
    ``/usr/bin/python3``.
    The same interpreter will be used in all operations that use the
    ansible deploy interface.
    It is also possible to override the value set in the configuration for a
    node by passing ``ansible_python_interpreter`` in its ``driver_info``.
