    Adds a ``ramdisk`` deploy interface for deployments that wish to network
    boot to a ramdisk, as opposed to perform a complete
    traditional deployment to a physical media. This may be useful in
    scientific use cases or where ephemeral baremetal machines are desired.

    The ``ramdisk`` deploy interface is intended for advanced users and has
    some particular operational caveats that the users should be aware of
    prior to use, such as network access list requirements and configuration
    drive architectural restrictions and the inability to leverage
    configuration drives.
