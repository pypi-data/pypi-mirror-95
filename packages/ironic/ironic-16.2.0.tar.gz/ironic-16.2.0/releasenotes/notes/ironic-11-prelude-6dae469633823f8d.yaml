    I R O N I C turns the dial to `11`

    In preparation for the OpenStack Rocky development cycle release,
    the "ironic" Bare Metal as a Service team announces the release of
    version 11.0. While it is not quite like a volume knob, this release
    lays the foundation for features coming in future releases and
    user experience enhancements.

    Some of these include the BIOS configuration framework, power fault
    recovery, additional error handling, refactoring, removal of classic
    drivers, and many bug fixes.
