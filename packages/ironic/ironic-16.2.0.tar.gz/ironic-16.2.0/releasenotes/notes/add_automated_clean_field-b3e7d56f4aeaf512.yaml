    Allows enabling automated cleaning per node if it is disabled globally.
    A new ``automated_clean`` field has been created on the node object,
    allowing to control the individual automated cleaning of nodes.
    When automated cleaning is disabled at global level, but enabled at node
    level, the automated cleaning will be performed only on those nodes.

    The new field is accessible starting with the API version 1.47.
