issues:
  - |
    The SNMP hardware type cannot change boot devices and thus may fail
    to deploy nodes with local boot. To work around this problem, set
    ``[pxe]enable_netboot_fallback`` to ``True``.
features:

    Adds an ability to generate network boot templates even for nodes that
    use local boot via the new ``[pxe]enable_netboot_fallback`` option.
    This is required to work around the situation where switching boot devices
    does not work reliably.
