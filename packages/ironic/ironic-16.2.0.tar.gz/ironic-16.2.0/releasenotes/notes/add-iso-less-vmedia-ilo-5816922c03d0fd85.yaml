features:
  - |
    Adds functionality to the ``ilo`` and ``ilo5`` hardware types
    by enabling virtual media boot without user-built
    deploy/rescue/boot ISO images. Instead, ironic will
    build necessary images out of common kernel/ramdisk
    pair (though user needs to provide ESP image).
    User provided deploy/rescue/boot ISO images are
    also supported.
  - |
    Adds support of DHCP less deploy to ``ilo`` and ``ilo5``
    hardware types by using the ``network_data`` property
    on the node field, operators can now apply network
    configuration to be embedded in iLO based Virtual
    Media based deployment ramdisks which include networking
    configuration enabling the deployment to operate without
    the use of DHCP.
