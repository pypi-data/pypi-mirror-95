    Fixes an issue where ``ironic-conductor`` initialization could return a
    ``NodeNotLocked`` error for requests requiring locks when the conductor
    was starting. This was due to the conductor removing locks after
    beginning accepting new work. The lock removal has been moved to after
    the Database connectivity has been established but before the RPC bus
    is initialized.
