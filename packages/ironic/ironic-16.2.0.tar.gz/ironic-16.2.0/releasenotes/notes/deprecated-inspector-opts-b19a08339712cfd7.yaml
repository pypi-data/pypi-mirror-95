deprecations:
  - |
    Configuration option ``[inspector]/service_url`` is deprecated
    and will be ignored in the Rocky release.
    Instead, use ``[inspector]/endpoint_override`` configuration option to set
    the specific ironic-inspector API endpoint when its automatic discovery
    from the keystone catalog is not desired.
    This new option has no default value (``None``) and must be set explicitly.

  - |
    Relying on the value of ``[DEFAULT]/auth_strategy`` configuration option to
    configure usage of standalone mode for ironic-inspector is deprecated and
    will be impossible the Rocky release.
    Instead, set ``[inspector]/auth_type`` configuration option to ``none`` and
    provide the ironic-inspector inspector API address as
    ``[inspector]/endpoint_override`` configuration option.
