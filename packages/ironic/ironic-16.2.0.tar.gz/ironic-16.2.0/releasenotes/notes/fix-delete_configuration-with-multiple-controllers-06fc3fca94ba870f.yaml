    Fixes a bug in the ``idrac`` hardware type where a race condition
    can occur on a host that has a mix of controllers where some support
    realtime mode and some do not. The approach is to use only realtime
    mode if all controllers support realtime. This removes the race
    condition.
    See bug `2006502 <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2006502>`_
    for details.
