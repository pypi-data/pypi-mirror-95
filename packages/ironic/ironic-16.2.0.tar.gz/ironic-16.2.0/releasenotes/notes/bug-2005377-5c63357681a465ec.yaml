fixes:
  - Fixes overflowing of the node fields ``last_error`` and
    ``maintenance_reason``, which would prevent the object from being correctly
    committed to the database.  The maximum message length can be customized
    through a new configuration parameter, ``[DEFAULT]/log_in_db_max_size``
    (default, 4096 characters).
