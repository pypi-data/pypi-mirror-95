    Adds support for software RAID via the generic hardware manager
    when using a Train release ``ironic-python-agent`` deployment or
    cleaning ramdisk.

    This may be used by means of the ``target_raid_config`` a single RAID-1
    or one RAID-1 plus one RAID-N can be configured (where N can be 0, 1,
    and 1+0). The RAID is created/deleted during manual cleaning. Note that
    this initial implementation will use all available devices for the setup
    of the software RAID device(s). More information is available in the
    Ironic Administrator
    `documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/raid.html#software-raid>`_.
