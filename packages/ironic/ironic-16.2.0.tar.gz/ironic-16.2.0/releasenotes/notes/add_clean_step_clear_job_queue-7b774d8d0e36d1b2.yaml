    interface.  The ``clear_job_queue`` cleaning step clears the Lifecycle
    Controller job queue including any pending jobs.

    Fixes an issue where if there is a pending BIOS config job in job queue,
    then ironic will abandon an introspection attempt for the node, which will
    cause overall introspection to fail.
