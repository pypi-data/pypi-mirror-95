    Changes the iPXE behavior to retry a total of 10 times with an increasing
    backoff time between each retry in order to not create a Denial of Service
    situation with the iPXE HTTP server. Should the retries fail, the node will
    be powered-off after a warning is displayed on the console for 30 seconds.
