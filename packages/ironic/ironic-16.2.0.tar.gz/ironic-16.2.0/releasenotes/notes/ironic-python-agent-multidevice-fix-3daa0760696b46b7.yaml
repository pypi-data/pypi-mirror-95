    The
    `ironic-python-agent <https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/ironic-python-agent>`_
    version 3.5.0 contains a fix that allows multi-device objects to be
    selected as a root disk. These devices MAY be created automatically in
    the case of some ATARAID controllers with pre-existing configuration,
    or via the actions of a custom hardware manager. Operators who require
    this functionality are encouraged to ensure that their deployment ramdisks
    are up to date. See `story 2003445 <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2003445>`_
    for more information.
