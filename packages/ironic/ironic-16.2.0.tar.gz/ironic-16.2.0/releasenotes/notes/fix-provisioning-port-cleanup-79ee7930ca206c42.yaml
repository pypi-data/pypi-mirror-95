    Fixes an issue whereby in certain deployment failure scenarios a node's
    provisioning ports are not deleted.  The issue would typically have been
    masked by nova, which deletes all ports with a device ID matching the
    instance's UUID during instance termination.  See `bug 1732412
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/1732412>`_
    for details.
