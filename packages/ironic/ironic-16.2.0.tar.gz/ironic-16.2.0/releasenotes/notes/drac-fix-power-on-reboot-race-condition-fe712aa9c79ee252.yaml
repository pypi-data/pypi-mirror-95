features:

    Adds a new configuration option ``[drac]boot_device_job_status_timeout``
    that specifies the maximum amount of time (in seconds) to wait for the boot
    device configuration job to transition to the scheduled state to allow a
    reboot or power on action to complete.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixes an issue in the ``idrac`` hardware type where a configuration job
    does not transition to the correct state and start execution during
    a power on or reboot operation. If the boot device is being changed,
    the system might complete its POST before the job is ready, leaving
    the job in the queue, and the system will boot from the wrong device.
