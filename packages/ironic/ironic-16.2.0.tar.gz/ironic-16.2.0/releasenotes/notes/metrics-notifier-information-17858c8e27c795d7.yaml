features:
  - |
    Notification events for metrics data now contains a ``node_name``
    field to assist operators with relating metrics data being transmitted
    by the conductor service.
fixes:
  - |
    Notification event types now include the hardware type name string as
    opposed to a static string of "ipmi". This allows event processors and
    operators to understand what the actual notification event data source
    is as opposed to having to rely upon fingerprints of the data to make
    such determinations.
