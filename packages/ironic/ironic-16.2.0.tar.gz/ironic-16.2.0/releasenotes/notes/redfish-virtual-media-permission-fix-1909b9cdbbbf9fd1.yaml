upgrade:
  - |
    A permission setting has been added for ``redfish-virtual-media`` boot
    interface, which allows for explicit file permission setting when the
    driver is used. The default for the new ``[redfish]file_permission
    setting is ``0u644``, or 644 if manually changed using ``chmod`` on the
    command line.
    Operators may need to check ``/httpboot/redfish`` folder permissions if
    using ``redfish-virtual-media`` if they were running the conductor with
    a specific ``umask`` to work around the permission setting defect.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixes an issue where the folder ``/httpboot/redfish`` was being created
    with incorrect permissions.
