    system in the first partition.

    For Software RAID, the IPA no longer assumes that the root file system
    of the deployed image is in the first partition. Instead, it will use
    the UUID passed from the conductor. Operators need hence to make sure
    that the conductor has the correct UUID (which either comes from the
    ``rootfs_uuid`` field in the image metadata or from the
    ``root_uuid_or_disk_id`` in the node's ``internal_driver_info``.)
