features:
  - |
    The ``pxe`` and ``ipxe`` boot interfaces now automatically configure
    secure boot if the management interface supports it.
deprecations:
  - |
    Currently the bare metal API permits setting the ``secure_boot`` capability
    for nodes, which driver does not support setting secure boot. This is
    deprecated and will become a failure in the Xena cycle.
other:
  - |
    Extends ``ManagementInterface`` with two new calls:
    ``get_secure_boot_state`` and ``set_secure_boot_state``. They are
    optional and may be implemented for hardware that supports dynamically
    enabling/disabling secure boot.
