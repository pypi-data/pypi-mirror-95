    Nodes and port groups with names ending with known file extensions are now
    correctly handled by the API. See `bug 1643995
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1643995>`_ for more details.
issues:
  - |
    If you have two nodes or port groups with names that only differ in
    a ``.json`` suffix (for example, ``test`` and ``test.json``) you won't be
    able to get, update or delete the one with the suffix via the
    ``/v1/nodes/<node>`` endpoint (``/v1/portgroups/<portgroup>`` for port
    groups). Similarly, the ``/v1/heartbeat/<node>`` endpoint won't work
    for the node with the suffix.

    To work around it, add one more ``.json`` suffix (for example, use
    ``/v1/nodes/test`` for node ``test`` and ``/v1/nodes/test.json.json``
    for ``test.json``). This issue will be addressed in one of the future
    API revisions.
