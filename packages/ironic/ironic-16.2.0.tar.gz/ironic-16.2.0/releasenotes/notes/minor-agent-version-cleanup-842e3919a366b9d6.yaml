    The ironic conductor internal logic has been updated to return an error if
    no agent version has been submitted during a heartbeat. This is because
    versions have been transmitted by the agents for quite some time and
    support for the default use of agent token forces all agents to be
    updated. As such redundant code been removed and tests updated accordingly.
