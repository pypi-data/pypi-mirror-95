    Fixes an issue where an ironic-conductor service was deemed dead because
    the service could not report its heartbeat due to the database connection
    experiencing an unexpected failure. Full tracebacks of these exceptions are
    now logged, and if the database connection recovers in a reasonable amount
    of time the service will still be available. See `bug 1696296
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/1696296>`_ for details.
