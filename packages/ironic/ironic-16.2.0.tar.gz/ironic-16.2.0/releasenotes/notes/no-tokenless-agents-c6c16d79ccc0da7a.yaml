upgrade:
  - |
    Support for token-less agents has been removed as the token-less agent
    support was deprecated in the Ussuri development cycle. The ironic-python-agent
    must be updated to 6.1.0 or higher to support communicating with the
    Ironic deployment after upgrade. This will generally require deployment,
    cleaning, and rescue kernels and ramdisks to be updated. If this is not
    done, actions such as cleaning and deployment will time out as the agent
    will be unable to record heartbeats with Ironic. For more information,
    please see the `agent token <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/agent-token.html>`_
    documentation.
security:
  - |
    Ramdisks supporting agent token are now globally required by Ironic.
    As this is a core security mechanism, it cannot be disabled and support
    for the ``[DEFAULT]require_agent_token`` configuration parameter has been
    removed as tokens are now always required by Ironic. For more information,
    please see the `agent token <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/agent-token.html>`_
    documentation.
