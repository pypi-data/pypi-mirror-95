    Fixes a bug in the ``idrac`` hardware type where when creating
    one or more virtual disks on a RAID controller that supports
    passthru mode (PERC H730P), the cleaning step would finish
    before the job to create the virtual disks actually completed.
    This could result in the client attempting to perform another
    action against the iDRAC that creates a configuration job, and
    that action would fail since the job to create the virtual disk
    would still be executing.
    This patch fixes this issue by only allowing the cleaning step to
    finish after the job to create the virtual disk completes.
