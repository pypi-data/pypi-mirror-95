critical:
  - The ``ironic-dbsync online_data_migrations`` command was not updating
    the objects to their latest versions, which could prevent upgrades from
    working (i.e. when running the next release's ``ironic-dbsync upgrade``).
    Objects are updated to their latest versions now when running that
    command. See `story 2004174
    <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2004174>`_ for more information.
upgrade:
  - If you are doing a minor version upgrade, please re-run the
    ``ironic-dbsync online_data_migrations`` command to properly update
    the versions of the Objects in the database. Otherwise, the next major
    upgrade may fail.
