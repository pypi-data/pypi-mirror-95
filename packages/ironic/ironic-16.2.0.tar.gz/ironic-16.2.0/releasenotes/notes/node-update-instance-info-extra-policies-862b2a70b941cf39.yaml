    Adds ``baremetal:node:update_extra`` and ``baremetal:node:instance_info``
    policies to allow finer-grained policy control over node updates. In order
    to use standalone Ironic to provision a node, a user must be able to
    update ``instance_info`` (and ``extra`` if using metalsmith), and a lessee
    should not be able to update all node attributes.
