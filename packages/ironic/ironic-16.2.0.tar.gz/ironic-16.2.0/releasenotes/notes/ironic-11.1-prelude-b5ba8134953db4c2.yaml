    Ironic `11.1`... Where the volume dial turned more!

    While Pixie Boots has rocked out to Rock and Roll, the Bare Metal
    as a Service team has wrapped up our Rocky release with 11.1.
    This new release contains a number of major features that we hope
    will improve the lives of bare metal operators everywhere!

    * Conductor grouping enabling nodes to be assigned to groups
      of different conductors.
    * Deployment steps framework enabling greater flexibility
      for deployers to request specific steps.
    * Bios setting interfaces for the ``ilo`` and ``irmc`` hardware types.
    * Ramdisk deployment interface for disk-less deployments.
    * Capability to reset nodes to their default interfaces via the API
      when resetting the node's driver.
