upgrade:
  - |
    The default value of ``[oslo_policy]policy_file`` config option has been
    changed from ``policy.json`` to ``policy.yaml``.
    Operators who are utilizing customized policy files or previously generated
    static policy files (which are not needed by default), should generate
    new policy files and modify them to meet their needs in the event of
    any new policies or rules have been added.
    Please consult the `oslopolicy-convert-json-to-yaml <https://docs.openstack.org/oslo.policy/latest/cli/oslopolicy-convert-json-to-yaml.html>`_
    tool to convert a JSON to YAML formatted policy file in
    backward compatible way.
deprecations:
  - |
    Use of legacy policy format was deprecated by the ``oslo.policy`` library
    during the Victoria development cycle. As a result, this deprecation is
    being noted in the Wallaby with an anticipated future removal of support
    by ``oslo.policy``. As such operators will need to convert to YAML policy
    files. Please see the upgrade notes for details on migration of any
    custom policy files.
