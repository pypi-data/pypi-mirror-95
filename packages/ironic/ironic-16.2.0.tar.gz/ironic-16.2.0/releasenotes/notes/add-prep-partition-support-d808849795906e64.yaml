features:
  - Added support for local booting a partition image for ppc64*
    hardware. If a PReP partition is detected when deploying to a
    ppc64* machine, the partition will be specified to IPA causing
    the bootloader to be installed there directly. This feature
    requires a ironic-python-agent ramdisk with ironic-lib >=2.14.
