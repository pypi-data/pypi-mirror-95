    Changes neutron port updates to use auth values from Ironic's neutron
    conf, preventing issues that can arise when a non-admin user manages
    Ironic nodes. A check is added to the port update function to verify that
    the user can actually see the port. This adds an additional Neutron
    request call to all port updates.
