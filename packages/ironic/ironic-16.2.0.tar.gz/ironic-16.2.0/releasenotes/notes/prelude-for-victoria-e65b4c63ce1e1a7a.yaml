    The Ironic team is proud to announce the release of Ironic 16.0.

    For over six years, the contributors to this project have continued
    to drive forth and provide what we collectively feel is the best
    platform for managing and deploying bare metal hardware.

    The innovation, the drive, and the pursuit of improving infrastructure
    operators' lives has yet to cease, and has no signs of stopping anytime
    soon.

    As with any release, we have some things we are particularly proud of:

    * Support for TLS encryption of Agent communications.
    * Support for in-band deployment steps enabling software RAID to be
      configured at deployment time.
    * Ramdisk/Virtual Media pass-through of ISO images.
    * BMC-less ``agent`` power control, so BMC's are not required
      for deployments.
    * Network configuration injection with virtual media based ramdisks.
    * Integrated basic authentication for standalone Ironic operators.

    And with any major release, a number of bugs have been fixed. Cross-vendor
    features see increased parity. Every contributor has something to be proud
    of in this release. And with that, we hope you enjoy it!
