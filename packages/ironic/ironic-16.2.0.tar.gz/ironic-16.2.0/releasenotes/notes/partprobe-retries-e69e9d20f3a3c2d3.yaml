upgrade:
  - |
    Adds a new configuration option ``[disk_utils]partprobe_attempts`` which
    defaults to 10. This is the maximum number of times to try to read a
    partition (if creating a config drive) via a ``partprobe`` command. Set
    it to 1 if you want the previous behavior, where no retries were done.

    Previously, no retries were done which caused failures. This addresses
