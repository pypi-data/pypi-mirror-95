    Certain RAID controllers (PERC H730P) require physical disks
    to be switched from non-RAID (JBOD) mode to RAID mode to be
    included in a virtual disk.  When this conversion happens,
    the available free space on the physical disk is reduced due
    to some space being allocated to RAID mode housekeeping.
    If the user requests a virtual disk (a RAID 1 for example)
    with a size close to the max size of the physical disks when
    they are in JBOD mode, then creation of the virtual disk
    following conversion of the physical disks from JBOD to RAID
    mode will fail since there is not enough space due to the
    space used by RAID mode housekeeping.
    This patch works around this issue by recalculating the RAID
    volume size after physical disk conversion has completed and
    the free space on the converted drives is known.  Note that
    this may result in a virtual disk that is slightly smaller
    than the requested size, but still the max size that the
    drives can support.
