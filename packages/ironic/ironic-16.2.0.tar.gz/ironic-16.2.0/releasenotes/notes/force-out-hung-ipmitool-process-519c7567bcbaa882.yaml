    Kill ``ipmitool`` process invoked by ironic to read node's power state if
    ``ipmitool`` process does not exit after configured timeout expires. It
    appears pretty common for ``ipmitool`` to run for five minutes (with
    current ironic defauls) once it hits a non-responsive bare metal node.
    This could slow down the management of other nodes due periodic tasks
    slots exhaustion. The new behaviour could is enabled by default, but
    could be disabled via the ``[ipmi]kill_on_timeout`` ironic configuration
    option.
