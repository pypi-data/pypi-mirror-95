    Fixes an issue with the ``ansible`` deployment interface where automatic
    root deviec selection would accidently choose the system CD-ROM device,
    which was likely to occur when the ansible deployment interface was used
    with virtual media boot.
    The ``ansible`` deployment interface now ignores all Ramdisks, Loopbacks,
    CD-ROMs, and floppy disk devices.
