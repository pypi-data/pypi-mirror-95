deprecations:
  - |
    The Fujitsu ``irmc`` hardware type has been deprecated. The Third Party
    CI for the driver stopped responding on or around July 7th, 2019. As such,
    we cannot claim fixes or changes to the driver are in a working state.

    We have heard from the Fujitsu team that they intend to return ``irmc``
    CI to working order, and as such should that occur this deprecation
    will be revoked.
