    Adds virtual media boot interface to ``redfish`` hardware type supporting
    virtual media boot. The ``redfish-virtual-media`` boot interface operates
    on the same kernel/ramdisk as, for example, PXE boot interface does, however
    ``redfish-virtual-media`` boot interface can additionally require EFI
    system partition image (ESP) when performing UEFI boot. Either the
    ``[conductor]bootloader`` configuration option or the
    ``[driver_info]/bootloader`` node attribute can be used to convey ESP
    location to ironic. Bootable ISO images can be served to BMCs either from
    Swift or from an HTTP server running on an ironic conductor machine. This
    is controlled by the ``[redfish]use_swift`` ironic configuration option.
