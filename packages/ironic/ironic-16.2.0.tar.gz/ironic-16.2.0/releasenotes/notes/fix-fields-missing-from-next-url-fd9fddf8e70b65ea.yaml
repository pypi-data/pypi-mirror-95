    Fixes issue where the resource list API returned results with requested
    fields only until the API ``MAX_LIMIT``. After the API ``MAX_LIMIT`` is
    reached the API started ignoring user requested fields. This fix will make
    sure that the next url generated by the pagination code will include the
    user requested fields as query parameter.
