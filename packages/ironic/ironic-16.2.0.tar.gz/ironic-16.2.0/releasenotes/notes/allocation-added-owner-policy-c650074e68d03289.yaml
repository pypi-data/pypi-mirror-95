    Adds ``is_allocation_owner`` policy rule, which can be applied to allocation
    get/update/delete rules. Also adds ``baremetal:allocation:list`` and
    ``baremetal:allocation:list_all`` rules for listing owned allocations and all
    allocations. Default rules are unaffected, so default behavior is unchanged.
