    Operators upgrading from earlier versions using PXE should explicitly set
    ``[pxe]ipxe_bootfile_name``, ``[pxe]uefi_ipxe_bootfile_name``, and
    possibly ``[pxe]ipxe_bootfile_name_by_arch`` settings, as well as a
    iPXE specific ``[pxe]ipxe_config_template`` override, if required.

    Setting the ``[pxe]ipxe_config_template`` to no value will result in the
    ``[pxe]pxe_config_template`` being used. The default value points to the
    supplied standard iPXE template, so only highly customized operators may
    have to tune this setting.
fixes:

    Addresses the lack of an ability to explicitly set different bootloaders
    for ``iPXE`` and ``PXE`` based boot operations via their respective
    ``ipxe`` and ``pxe`` boot interfaces.
