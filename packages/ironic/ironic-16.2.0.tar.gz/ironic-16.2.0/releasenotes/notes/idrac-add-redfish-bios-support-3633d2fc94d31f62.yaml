    Adds support for managing BIOS settings via the Redfish out-of-band
    (OOB) management protocol to the ``idrac`` hardware type. The new
    hardware BIOS interface implementation which offers it is named
    ``idrac-redfish``.

    The ``idrac`` hardware type declares support for that new interface
    implementation, in addition to all BIOS interface implementations it
    has been supporting. The highest priority BIOS interface remains the
    same, the one which relies on the Web Services Management (WS-Man)
    OOB management protocol. The new ``idrac-redfish`` immediately
    follows it. It now supports the following BIOS interface
    implementations, listed in priority order from highest to lowest:
    ``idrac-wsman``, ``idrac-redfish``, and ``no-bios``.
