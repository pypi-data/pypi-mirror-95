    Adds support for ``deploy_steps`` parameter to provisioning endpoint
    ``/v1/nodes/{node_ident}/states/provision``. Available and optional when
    target is 'active' or 'rebuild'. When overlapping, these steps override
    deploy template and driver steps. ``deploy_steps`` is a list of
    dictionaries with required keys 'interface', 'step', 'priority' and 'args'.
