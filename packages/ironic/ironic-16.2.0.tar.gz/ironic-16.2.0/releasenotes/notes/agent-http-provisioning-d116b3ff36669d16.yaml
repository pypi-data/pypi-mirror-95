features:
  - Adds the ability to provision with ``direct`` deploy interface and custom
    HTTP service running at ironic conductor node. A new configuration option
    ``[agent]image_download_source`` is introduced. When set to ``swift``,
    the ``direct`` deploy interface uses tempurl generated via the Object
    service as the source of instance image during provisioning, this is the
    default configuration. When set to ``http``, the ``direct`` deploy
    interface downloads instance image from the Image service, and caches the
    image in the ironic conductor node. The cached instance images are
    referenced by symbolic links located at subdirectory
    ``[deploy]http_image_subdir`` under path ``[deploy]http_root``. The custom
    HTTP server running at ironic conductor node is supposed to be configured
    properly to make IPA has unauthenticated access to image URL described
    above.
