    Adds the ability for Ironic to attach a node to a specific port or portgroup.
    This is accomplished by having the node vif_attach API accept a port_uuid or
    portgroup_uuid key within vif_info. If one is specified, then Ironic will
    attempt to attach to the specified port/portgroup. Specifying both returns
    an error.
