features:
  - |
    Adds a new ``[ipmi]debug`` option that allows users to explicitly turn
    IPMI command debugging on, as opposed to relying upon the system debug
    setting ``[DEFAULT]debug``. Users wishing to continue to log this output
    should set ``[ipmi]debug`` to ``True`` in their ironic.conf.
upgrade:
  - Debug logging control has been moved to the ``[ipmi]debug`` configuration
    setting as opposed to the "conductor" ``[DEFAULT]debug`` setting as
    the existing ``ipmitool`` output can be extremely misleading for users.
    Operators who wish to continue to log ``ipmitool`` verbose output in their
    logs should explicitly set the ``[ipmi]debug`` command to True.
