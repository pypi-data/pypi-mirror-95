upgrade:
  - The deprecated configuration option ``[conductor]inspect_timeout`` was
    removed, please use ``[conductor]inspect_wait_timeout`` instead.
other:
  - The support for returning ``INSPECTING`` state from
    ``InspectInterface.inspect_hardware`` was removed. For asynchronous
    inspection, please return ``INSPECTWAIT`` instead of ``INSPECTING``,
    otherwise the node will be moved to ``inspect failed`` state.
