features:
  - |
    Adds support for running custom in-band deploy steps when provisioning.
    Step priorities from 41 to 59 can be used for steps that run after
    the image is written and the bootloader is installed.
deprecations:
  - |
    Running the whole deployment process as a monolithic ``deploy.deploy``
    deploy step is now deprecated. In a future release this step will only be
    used to prepare deployment and starting the agent, and special handling
    will be removed. All third party deploy interfaces must be updated
    to provide real deploy steps instead and set the
    ``has_decomposed_deploy_steps`` attribute to ``True`` on the deploy
    interface level.
other:
  - |
    As part of the agent deploy interfaces refactoring, breaking changes will
    be made to implementations of ``AgentDeploy`` and ``ISCSIDeploy``.
    Third party deploy interfaces must be updated to inherit
    ``HeartbeatMixin``, ``AgentBaseMixin`` or ``AgentDeployMixin``
    from ``ironic.drivers.modules.agent_base`` instead since their API is
    considered more stable.
