    Register all conductor hardware interfaces together. Adds
    all conductor hardware interfaces in to the database in a
    single transaction and to allow this update the
    ``register_hardware_interfaces`` API. This allows Restful API
    consumers to understand if the conductor is fully on-line via
    the presence of driver entries. Previously this was done one
    driver at a time.
