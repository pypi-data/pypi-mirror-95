    Adds ``instance_info/kernel_append_params`` property support to ``redfish``
    hardware type. If given, this property overrides
    ``[redfish]/kernel_append_params`` ironic option. The rationale for adding
    this property is to allow passing node-specific kernel parameters to instance
    kernel. One of the use-cases for this is to pass node static network
    configuration to the kernel.
