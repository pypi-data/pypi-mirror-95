    Fixes an agent command issue in the bootloader installation process that
    can present itself as a connection timeout under heavy IO load conditions.
    Now installation commands have an internal timeout which is double the
    conductor wide ``[agent]command_timeout``. For more information, see
    bug `2007483 <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2007483>`_.
