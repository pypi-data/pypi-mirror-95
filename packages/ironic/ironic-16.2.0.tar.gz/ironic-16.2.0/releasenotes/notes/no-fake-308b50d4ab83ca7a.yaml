    All fake classic drivers, deprecated in the Queens release, have been
    removed. This includes:

    * ``fake``
    * ``fake_agent``
    * ``fake_cimc``
    * ``fake_drac``
    * ``fake_ilo``
    * ``fake_inspector``
    * ``fake_ipmitool``
    * ``fake_ipmitool_socat``
    * ``fake_irmc``
    * ``fake_oneview``
    * ``fake_pxe``
    * ``fake_snmp``
    * ``fake_soft_power``
    * ``fake_ucs``

    Please use the ``fake-hardware`` hardware type instead (you can combine
    it with any other interfaces, fake or real).
