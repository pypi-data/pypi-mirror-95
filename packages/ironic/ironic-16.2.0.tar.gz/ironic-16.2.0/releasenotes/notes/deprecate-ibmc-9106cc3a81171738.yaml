deprecations:

    The ``ibmc`` hardware type has been deprecated. While the Huawei team
    setup Third-Party CI for the driver's inclusion into ironic, the CI
    unfortunately went down around the time the United States of America
    announced commerce restrictions against Huawei.
    
    Unfortunantely, without third party CI and no contacts to maintain the
    driver, the ironic community is left with little choice but to deprecate
    and ultimately remove the driver.
