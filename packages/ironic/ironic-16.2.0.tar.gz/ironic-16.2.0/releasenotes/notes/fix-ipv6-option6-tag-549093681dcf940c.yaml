issues:
  - |
    Support for IPv6 and iPXE is restricted and is unlikely to work in default
    scenarios and configurations without external intervention. This is due to
    the way DHCPv6 and dnsmasq operate. At present this issue is being tracked
    in story `2005402 <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2004502>`_.
fixes:

    Fixes an issue introduced during the Stein development cycle in an attempt
    to fix IPv6 support where the networking service was also prepending the
    DHCP option indicator to the number. A fix has been been submitted to the
    Networking service to address this issue, and the prepending code has been
    removed from ironic. See story
    `2004501 <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2004501>`_ for more
    information.
