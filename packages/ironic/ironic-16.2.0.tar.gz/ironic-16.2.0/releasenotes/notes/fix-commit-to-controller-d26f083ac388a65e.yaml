    Fixes a bug in the ``idrac`` hardware type where configuration job
    for RAID ``delete_configuration`` cleaning step gets created even
    when there are no virtual disks or hotspares/dedicated hotspares
    present on any controller.
    See bug `2006562 <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2006562>`_
