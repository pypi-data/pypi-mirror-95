    Using the ``network_data`` property on the node field,
    operators can now apply network configuration to be embedded
    in Redfish based Virtual Media based deployment ramdisks which
    include networking configuration enabling the deployment to operate
    without the use of DHCP. See Redfish driver documentation for
    `more information <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/drivers/redfish.html#layer-3-or-dhcp-less-ramdisk-booting>`_.
