    Fixes an issue where a provisioned or allocated node could have its owner
    changed. For backwards compatibility, we preserve the ability to do so
    for a provisioned node through the use of the
    ``baremetal:node:update_owner_provisioned`` policy rule. We always prevent
    the update if the node is associated with an allocation that specifies an
    owner.
