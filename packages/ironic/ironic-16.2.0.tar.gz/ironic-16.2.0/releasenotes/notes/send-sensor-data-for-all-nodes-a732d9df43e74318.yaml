    Adds a ``[conductor]send_sensor_data_for_undeployed_nodes`` option to
    enable ironic to collect and transmit sensor data for all nodes
    for which sensor data collection is available. By default, this option
    is not enabled which aligns with the prior behavior of sensor data
    collection and transmission where such data was only collected
    if an ``instance_uuid`` was present to signify that the node has been or
    is being deployed. With this option set to ``True``, operators may be able
    to identify hardware in a faulty state through the sensor data and take
    action before an instance workload is deployed.

    Fixes an issue where nodes in the process of deployment may have metrics
    data collected and transmitted during the deployment process which
    may erroneously generate alarms depending on the operator's monitoring
    configuration. This was due to a database filter relying upon the
    indicator of an ``instance_uuid`` as opposed to the state of a node.
