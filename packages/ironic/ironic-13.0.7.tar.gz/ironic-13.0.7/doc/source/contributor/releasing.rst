Releasing Ironic Projects
=========================

Since the responsibility for releases will move between people, we document
that process here.

A full list of projects that ironic manages is available in the `governance
site`_.

.. _`governance site`: https://governance.openstack.org/reference/projects/ironic.html

Who is responsible for releases?
================================

The current PTL is ultimately responsible for making sure code gets released.
They may choose to delegate this responsibility to a liaison, which is
documented in the `cross-project liaison wiki`_.

Anyone may submit a release request per the process below, but the PTL or
liaison must +1 the request for it to be processed.

Release process
===============

Releases are managed by the OpenStack release team. The release process is
documented in the `Project Team Guide`_.

.. _`Project Team Guide`: https://docs.openstack.org/project-team-guide/release-management.html#how-to-release

Things to do before releasing
=============================

* Review the unreleased release notes, if the project uses them. Make sure
  they follow our :ref:`standards <faq_release_note>`, are coherent, and have
  proper grammar.
  Combine release notes if necessary (for example, a release note for a
  feature and another release note to add to that feature may be combined).

* For ironic releases only, not ironic-inspector releases: if any new API
  microversions have been added since the last release, update the REST API
  version history (``doc/source/contributor/webapi-version-history.rst``) to
  indicate that they were part of the new release.

* To support rolling upgrades, add this new release version (and release name
  if it is a named release) into ``ironic/common/release_mappings.py``:

  * in ``RELEASE_MAPPING`` make a copy of the ``master`` entry, and rename the
    first ``master`` entry to the new semver release version.

  * If this is a named release, add a ``RELEASE_MAPPING`` entry for the named
    release. Its value should be the same as that of the latest semver one
    (that you just added above).

    It is important to do this before a stable/<release> branch is made (or if
    `the grenade switch is made <http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2017-February/111849.html>`_
    to use the latest release from stable as the 'old' release).
    Otherwise, once it is made, CI (the grenade job that tests new-release ->
    master) will fail.

Things to do after releasing
============================

When a release is done that results in a stable branch
------------------------------------------------------
When a release is done that results in a stable branch for the project,
several changes need to be made.

The release automation will push a number of changes that need to be approved.
This includes:

* In the new stable branch:

  * a change to point ``.gitreview`` at the branch
  * a change to update the upper constraints file used by ``tox``

* In the master branch:

  * updating the release notes RST to include the new branch.

    The generated RST does not include the version range in the title, so we
    typically submit a follow-up patch to do that. We also manually mark
    the ``earliest-version`` directive on the new page, due to a `reno bug
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/reno/+bug/1746076>` that may cause this to
    be incorrect for stable branches.

We need to submit patches for changes in the stable branch to:

* update the ironic devstack plugin to point at the branched tarball for IPA.
  An example of this patch is
  `here <https://review.opendev.org/#/c/374863/>`_.
* update links in the documentation (``ironic/doc/source/``) to point to the
  branched versions of any openstack projects' (that branch) documents.
  As of Pike release, the only outlier is
  `diskimage-builder <https://docs.openstack.org/diskimage-builder/latest/>`_.
* set appropriate defaults for ``TEMPEST_BAREMETAL_MIN_MICROVERSION`` and
  ``TEMPEST_BAREMETAL_MAX_MICROVERSION`` in ``devstack/lib/ironic`` to make sure
  that unsupported API tempest tests are skipped on stable branches. E.g.
  `patch 495319 <https://review.opendev.org/495319>`_.

We need to submit patches for changes on master to:

* create an empty commit with a ``Sem-Ver`` tag to bump the generated minor
  version. See `example
  <https://opendev.org/openstack/ironic/commit/4b28af4645c2f3b6d7864671e15904ed8f40414d>`_
  and `pbr documentation
  <https://docs.openstack.org/pbr/latest/user/features.html#version>`_ for details.

* to support rolling upgrades, since the release was a named release, we
  need to make these changes. Note that we need to wait until *after* the
  switch in grenade is made to test the latest release (N) with master
  (e.g. `for stable/queens <https://review.opendev.org/#/c/543615>`_).
  Doing these changes sooner -- after the ironic release and before the switch
  when grenade is testing the prior release (N-1) with master, will cause
  the tests to fail. (You may want to ask/remind infra/qa team, as to
  when they will do this switch.)

  * In ``ironic/common/release_mappings.py``, delete any entries from
    ``RELEASE_MAPPING`` associated with the oldest named release. Since we
    support upgrades between adjacent named releases, the master branch will
    only support upgrades from the most recent named release to master.

  * remove any DB migration scripts from ``ironic.cmd.dbsync.ONLINE_MIGRATIONS``
    and remove the corresponding code from ironic. (These migration scripts
    are used to migrate from an old release to this latest release; they
    shouldn't be needed after that.)

  * remove any model class names from ``ironic.cmd.dbsync.NEW_MODELS``.

As **ironic-tempest-plugin** is branchless, we need to submit a patch adding
stable jobs to its master branch. `Example for Queens
<https://review.opendev.org/#/c/543555/>`_.

For all releases
----------------

For all releases, whether or not it results in a stable branch:

* update the specs repo to mark any specs completed in the release as
  implemented.

* remove any -2s on patches that were blocked until after the release.
