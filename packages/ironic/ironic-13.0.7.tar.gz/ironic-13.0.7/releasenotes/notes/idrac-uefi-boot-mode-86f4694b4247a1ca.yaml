    Fixes an issue that caused the integrated Dell Remote Access
    Controller (iDRAC) ``management`` hardware interface implementation,
    ``idrac``, to fail to boot nodes in Unified Extensible Firmware Interface
    (UEFI) boot mode. That interface is supported by the ``idrac`` hardware
    type. The issue is resolved for Dell EMC PowerEdge 13th and 14th generation
    servers. It is not resolved for PowerEdge 12th generation and earlier
    servers. For more information, see `story 1656841
