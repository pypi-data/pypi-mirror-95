    The cleaning operation may fail, if an in-band clean step were to
    execute after the completion of out-of-band clean step that
    performs reboot of the node. The failure is caused because of race
    condition where in cleaning is resumed before the Ironic Python
    Agent(IPA) is ready to execute clean steps. This has been fixed.
