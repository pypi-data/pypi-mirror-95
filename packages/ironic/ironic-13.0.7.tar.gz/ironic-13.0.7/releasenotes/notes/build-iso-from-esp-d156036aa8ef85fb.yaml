features:
  - |
    Allows the user to supply EFI system partition image to ironic, for
    building UEFI-bootable ISO images, in form of a local file or UUID
    or URI reference. The new ``[conductor]esp_image`` option can be used
    to configure ironic to use local file.
fixes:
  - |
    Makes ironic building UEFI-only bootable ISO image (when being asked to
    build a UEFI-bootable image) rather than building a hybrid
    BIOS/UEFI-bootable ISO.
