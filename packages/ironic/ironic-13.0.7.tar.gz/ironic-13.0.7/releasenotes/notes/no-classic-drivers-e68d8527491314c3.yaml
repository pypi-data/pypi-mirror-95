upgrade:
  - |
    It is no longer possible to load a classic driver. Only hardware types
    are supported from now on.
  - |
    The ``/v1/drivers/?type=classic`` API always returns an empty list since
    classic drivers can no longer be loaded.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``enabled_drivers`` option is now deprecated. Since classic drivers
    can no longer be loaded, setting this option to anything non-empty will
    result in the conductor failing to start.
