    Fixes an issue where the sensor data parsing method for the ``ipmitool``
    interface lacked the ability to handle the automatically included
    `ipmitool` debugging information when the ``debug`` option is set to
    ``True`` in the ironic.conf file. As such, extra debugging information
    supplied by the underlying ``ipmitool`` command is disregarded.
