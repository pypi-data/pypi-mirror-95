    Fixes ``redfish`` hardware type to reuse HTTP session tokens when
    talking to BMC using session authentication. Prior to this fix ``redfish``
    hardware type never tried to reuse session token given out by BMC during
    previous connection what may sometimes lead to session pool exhaustion
    with some BMC implementations.
