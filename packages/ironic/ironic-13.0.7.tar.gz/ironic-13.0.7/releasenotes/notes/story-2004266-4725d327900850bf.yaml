    The IPMI hardware type unconditionally instructed the BMC to not
    automatically clear boot flag valid bit if Chassis Control command not
    received within 60-second timeout (countdown restarts when a Chassis
    Control command is received).  Some BMCs do not support setting this; if
    sent it causes the boot to be aborted instead.  For IPMI hardware type a
    new driver option ``node['driver_info']['ipmi_disable_boot_timeout']`` can
    be specified.  It is ``True`` by default; set it to ``False`` to bypass
    sending this command.  See `story 2004266
    <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2004266>`_ for additional
    information.
