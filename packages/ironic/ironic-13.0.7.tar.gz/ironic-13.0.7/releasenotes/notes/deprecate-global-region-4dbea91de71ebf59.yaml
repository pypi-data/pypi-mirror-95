  - |
    Configuration option ``[keystone]/region_name`` is deprecated
    and will be ignored in the Rocky release.
    Instead, provide per-service ``region_name`` option in the following
    configuration file sections: ``[service_catalog]`` (for bare metal API
    endpoint discovery from keystone service catalog), ``[glance]``,
    ``[neutron]``, ``[cinder]``, ``[inspector]`` and ``[swift]``.
