    Fixes a compatability issue where the iPXE kernel command line was no
    longe compatible with dracut. The ``ip`` parameter has been removed
    as it is incompatible with the ``BOOTIF`` and missing ``autoconf``
    parameters when dracut is used. Further details can be found in
    `storyboard <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2001969>`_.
