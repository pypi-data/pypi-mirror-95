deprecations:
  - |
    The Cisco ``cisco-ucs-managed`` and ``cisco-ucs-standalone`` drivers have
    been deprecated due to a lack of reporting third-party CI and vendor
    maintenance of the driver code. In the present state of these drivers,
    they would have been removed as part of the eventual removal of support
    for Python2. These drivers should be anticipated to be removed prior to
    the final Train release of the Bare Metal service. More information
    can be found
    `here <http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-discuss/2019-February/002460.html>`_.
