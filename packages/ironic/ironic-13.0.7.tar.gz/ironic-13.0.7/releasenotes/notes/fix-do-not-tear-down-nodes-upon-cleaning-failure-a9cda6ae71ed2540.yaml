fixes:

    Fixes a bug where ironic would shut a node down upon cleaning failure.
    Now, the node stays powered on (as documented and intended).
upgrade:
  - |
    When a failure occurs during cleaning, nodes will no longer be shut down. The
    behaviour was changed to prevent harm and allow for an admin intervention
    when sensitive operations, such as firmware upgrades, are performed and fail
    during cleaning.
