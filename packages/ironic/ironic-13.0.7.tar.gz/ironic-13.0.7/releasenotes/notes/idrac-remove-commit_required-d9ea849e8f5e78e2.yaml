    Removes ``commit_required`` from the dictionary returned by
    the ``set_bios_config`` vendor passthru call in the ``idrac`` hardware
    type.  ``commit_required`` was split into two keys: ``is_commit_required``
    and ``is_reboot_required``, which indicate the actions necessary to
    complete setting the BIOS settings.  ``commit_required`` was removed in
    ``python-dracclient`` version 3.0.0.
