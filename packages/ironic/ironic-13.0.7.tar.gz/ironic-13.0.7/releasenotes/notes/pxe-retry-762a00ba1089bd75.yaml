    Allows retrying PXE/iPXE boot during deployment, cleaning and rescuing.
    This feature is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting
    ``[pxe]boot_retry_timeout`` to the timeout (in seconds) after which
    the boot should be retried.

    The new option ``[pxe]boot_retry_check_interval`` defines how often to
    check the nodes for timeout and defaults to 90 seconds.
