deprecations:
  - |
    The ``xclarity`` hardware type, as well as the supporting
    driver interfaces have been deprecated and are scheduled to be removed
    from ironic in the Stein development cycle. This is due to the lack of
    operational Third Party testing to help ensure that the support for
    Lenovo XClarity is functional.

    The ``xclarity`` hardware type was introduced at the end of the Queens
    development cycle. During implementation of Third Party CI, the Lenovo
    team encountered some unforseen delays. Lenovo is continuing to work
    towards Third Party CI, and upon establishment and verification of
    functional Third Party CI, this deprecation will be rescinded.
