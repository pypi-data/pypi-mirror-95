    Adds an ``is_smartnic`` field to the port object in REST API version
    1.53.

    ``is_smartnic`` field indicates if this port is a Smart NIC port,
    False by default. This field may be set by operator to use baremetal
    nodes with Smart NICs as ironic nodes.

    The REST API endpoints related to ports provide support for the
    ``is_smartnic`` field.  The `ironic admin documentation
    <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/multitenancy.html>`_
    provides information on how to configure and use Smart NIC ports.
