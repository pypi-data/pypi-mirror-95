    To use CoreOS based deploy/cleaning ramdisk built using Ironic Python Agent
    from the Rocky release, Ironic should be upgraded to the Rocky release if
    PXE is used. Otherwise, a node cannot be deployed or cleaned because the
    IPA fails to boot due to an unsupported parameter passed via PXE. See
    `bug 2002093 <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2002093>`_ for
    details.
