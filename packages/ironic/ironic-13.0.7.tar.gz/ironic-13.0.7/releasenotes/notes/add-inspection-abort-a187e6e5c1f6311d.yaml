    Adds support to abort the inspection of a node in the ``inspect wait``
    state, as long as this operation is supported by the inspect interface in
    use. A node in the ``inspect wait`` state accepts the ``abort``
    provisioning verb to initiate the abort process.
    This feature is supported by the ``inspector`` inspect interface and
    is available starting with API version 1.41.
