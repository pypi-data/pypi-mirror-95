features:
  - |
    Allows specifying the provisioning and cleaning networks on a node as
    ``driver_info['cleaning_network']`` and
    ``driver_info['provisioning_network']`` respectively. If these
    values are defined in the node's driver_info at the time of
    provisioning or cleaning the baremetal node, they will be used.
    Otherwise, the configuration options ``cleaning_network`` and
    ``provisioning_network`` are used as before.
fixes:
  - |
    A network UUID for provisioning and cleaning network is no longer cached
    locally if the requested network (either via node's ``driver_info`` or
    via configuration options) is specified as a network name. Fixes the
    situation when a network is re-created with the same name.
