fixes:
  - |
    Fixes the default disk detection in the ``ansible`` deploy interface with
    Python 3. Previously a random disk was used, resulting in boot failures,
    now the first disk is used (as intended). This required bumping the minimum
    required Ansible version to 2.5.
upgrade:

    Changing minimum version of Ansible for use with the ``ansible``
    ``deploy_interface`` to version 2.5.
