    Conductors and nodes may be arbitrarily grouped to provide a basic level
    of affinity between conductors and nodes. Conductors use the
    ``[conductor]/conductor_group`` configuration option to set the group
    which they belong to. The same value may be set on one or more nodes
    in the ``conductor_group`` field (available in API version 1.46), and
    these will be matched such that only conductors with a given group will
    manage nodes with the same group.

    A group name may be up to 255 characters containing ``a-z``, ``0-9``,
    ``_``, ``-``, and ``.``. The group is case-insensitive. The default group
    is the empty string (``""``).

    The "node list" API endpoint (``GET /v1/nodes``) may also be filtered by
    conductor group in API version 1.46.
