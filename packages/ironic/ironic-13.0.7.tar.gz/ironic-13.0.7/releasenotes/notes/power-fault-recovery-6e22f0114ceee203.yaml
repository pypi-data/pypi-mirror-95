    Adds power failure recovery to ironic. For nodes that ironic had put into
    maintenance mode due to power failure, ironic periodically checks their
    power state, and moves them out of maintenance mode when power state can
    be retrieved. The interval of this check is configured via
    ``[conductor]power_failure_recovery_interval`` configuration option, the
    default value is 300 (seconds). Set to 0 to disable this behavior.
upgrade:
  - |
    Power failure recovery introduces a new configuration option
    ``[conductor]power_failure_recovery_interval``, which is enabled and set
    to 300 seconds by default. In case the default value is not suitable for
    the needs or scale of a deployment, please make adjustment or turn it off
    during upgrade.
  - |
    Power failure recovery does not apply to nodes that were in maintenance
    mode due to power failure before upgrade, they have to be manually moved
    out of maintenance mode.
