    Adds initial ``idrac`` hardware type support of interface
    implementations that utilize the Redfish out-of-band (OOB)
    management protocol and are compatible with the integrated Dell
    Remote Access Controller (iDRAC) baseboard management controller
    (BMC), presently those of the management and power hardware
    interfaces. They are named ``idrac-redfish``.

    Introduces a new name for the ``idrac`` interface implementations,
    ``idrac-wsman``, and deprecates ``idrac``. They both use the Web
    Services Management (WS-Man) OOB management protocol.

    The ``idrac`` hardware type declares support for those new interface
    implementations, in addition to all interface implementations it has
    been supporting. The priority order of supported interfaces remains
    the same. Interface implementations which rely on WS-Man continue to
    have the highest priority, and the new ``idrac-wsman`` is listed
    before the deprecated ``idrac``. It now supports the following
    interface implementations, which are listed in priority order from
    highest to lowest:

    * bios: ``no-bios``
    * boot: ``ipxe``, ``pxe``
    * console: ``no-console``
    * deploy: ``iscsi``, ``direct``, ``ansible``, ``ramdisk``
    * inspect: ``idrac-wsman``, ``idrac``, ``inspector``, ``no-inspect``
    * management: ``idrac-wsman``, ``idrac``, ``idrac-redfish``
    * network: ``flat``, ``neutron``, ``noop``
    * power:  ``idrac-wsman``, ``idrac``, ``idrac-redfish``
    * raid: ``idrac-wsman``, ``idrac``, ``no-raid``
    * rescue: ``no-rescue``, ``agent``
    * storage: ``noop``, ``cinder``, ``external``
    * vendor: ``idrac-wsman``, ``idrac``, ``no-vendor``

deprecations:
  - |
    The ``idrac`` interface implementation name is deprecated in favor
    of a new name, ``idrac-wsman``, and may be removed in a future
    release. A deprecation warning will be logged for every loaded
    ``idrac`` interface implementation. Use ``idrac-wsman`` instead.
