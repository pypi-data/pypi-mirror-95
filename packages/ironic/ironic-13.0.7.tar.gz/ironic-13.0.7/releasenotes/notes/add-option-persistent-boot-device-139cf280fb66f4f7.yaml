features:
  - |
    Adds capability to control the persistency of boot order changes during
    instance deployment via (i)PXE on a per-node level. The option
    'force_persistent_boot_device' in the node's driver info for the (i)PXE
    drivers is extended to allow the values 'Default' (make all changes
    but the last one upon deployment non-persistent), 'Always' (make all
    changes persistent), and 'Never' (make all boot order changes
    non-persistent).
deprecations:
  - |
    The values 'True'/'False' for the option 'force_persistent_boot_device'
    in the node's driver info for the (i)PXE drivers are deprecated and
    support for them may be removed in a future release. The former default
    value 'False' is replaced by the new value 'Default', the value 'True'
    is replaced by 'Always'.
