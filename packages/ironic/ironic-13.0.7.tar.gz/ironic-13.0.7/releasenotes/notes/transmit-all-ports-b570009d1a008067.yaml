    Provides an opt-in fix to change the default port attachment behavior
    for deployment and cleaning operations through a new configuration option,
    ``[neutron]add_all_ports``. This option causes ironic to transmit all
    port information to neutron as opposed to only a single physical network
    port. This enables operators to successfully operate static Port Group
    configurations with Neutron ML2 drivers, where previously configuration
    of networking would fail.

    When these ports are configured with ``pxe_enabled`` set to ``False``,
    neutron will be requested not to assign an IP address to the port. This
    is to prevent additional issues that may occur depending on physical
    switch configuration with static Port Group configurations.

    Fixes an issue during provisioning network attachment where
    neutron ports were being created with the same data structure
    being re-used.
