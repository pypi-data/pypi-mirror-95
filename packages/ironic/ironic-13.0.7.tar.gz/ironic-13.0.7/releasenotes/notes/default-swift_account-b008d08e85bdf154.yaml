features:
  - |
    If the ``[glance]swift_account`` option is not set, the default value is
    now calculated based on the ID of the project used to access the object
    store.  Previously this option was required. This change does not affect
    using RadosGW as an object store backend.
  - |
    If the ``[glance]swift_temp_url_key`` option is not set, ironic now tries
    to fetch the key from the project used to access swift (often
    called ``service``). This change does not affect using RadosGW as an
    object store backend.
  - |
    If the ``[glance]swift_endpoint_url`` option is not set, ironic now tries
    to fetch the Object Store service URL from the service catalog. The
    ``/v1/AUTH_*`` suffix is stripped, if present.
