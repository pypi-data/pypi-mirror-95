deprecations:
  - |
    Using the ``fake`` management interface with the ``manual-management``
    hardware type is deprecated, please use ``noop`` instead. Existing nodes
    will have to be updated after the upgrade.
fixes:
  - |
    The ``manual-management`` hardware type now defaults to the ``noop``
    management interface. Unlike the ``fake`` management interface, it does
    not fail on attempt to set the boot device to the local disk.
