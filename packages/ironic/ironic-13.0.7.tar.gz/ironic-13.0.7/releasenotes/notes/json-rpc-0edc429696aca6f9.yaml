    Adds the ability to use JSON RPC for communication between API and
    conductor services. To use it set the new ``rpc_transport`` configuration
    options to ``json-rpc`` and configure the credentials and the ``host_ip``
    in the ``json_rpc`` section. Hostnames of all conductors must be
    resolvable for this implementation to work.
