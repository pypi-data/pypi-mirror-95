other:
  - Adds ``get_boot_mode``, ``set_boot_mode`` and
    ``get_supported_boot_modes`` methods to driver management interface.
    Drivers can override these methods implementing boot mode management
    calls to the BMC of the baremetal nodes being managed.
features:
  - The new ironic configuration setting ``[deploy]/default_boot_mode``
    allows the operator to set the default boot mode when ironic can't
    pick boot mode automatically based on node configuration, hardware
    capabilities, or bare-metal machine configuration.
fixes:
  - If the bare metal machine's boot mode differs from the requested one,
    ironic will now attempt to set requested boot mode on the bare metal
    machine and fail explicitly if the driver does not support setting
    boot mode on the node.
