features:
  - Adds a configuration option ``[deploy]disk_erasure_concurrency`` to
    define the target pool size used by Ironic Python Agent ramdisk to
    erase disk devices. The number of threads created by IPA to erase
    disk devices is the minimum value of target pool size and the number of
    disks to be erased. This feature can greatly reduce the operation time
    for baremetals with multiple disks. For the backwards compatibility,
    the default value is 1.
