deprecations:
  - |
    Configuration option ``[cinder]/url`` is deprecated
    and will be ignored in the Rocky release.
    Instead, use ``[cinder]/endpoint_override`` configuration option to set
    a specific cinder API address when automatic discovery of the cinder API
    endpoint from keystone catalog is not desired.
