deprecations:
  - |
    Configuration option ``glance_api_servers`` from the ``[glance]``
    section in the configuration file is deprecated
    and will be ignored in the Rocky release.
    Instead, use ``[glance]/endpoint_override`` configuration option to set
    a specific (possibly load-balanced) glance API address when automatic
    discovery of glance API endpoint from keystone catalog is not desired.
    This new option defaults to ``None`` and must be set explicitly if needed.
    This new option is mostly suited for standalone ironic deployments without
    keystone and its service catalog, and it is generally recommended to
    rely on keystone service catalog for service endpoint discovery.

  - |
    Configuration option ``[glance]/glance_api_insecure`` is deprecated
    and will be ignored in the Rocky release.
    Instead, use ``[glance]/insecure`` configuration option
    (its default is ``False``).

  - |
    Configuration option ``[glance]/glance_cafile`` is deprecated
    and will be ignored in the Rocky release.
    Instead, use ``[glance]/cafile`` configuration option
    (its default is ``None``).
  - |
    Configuration option ``[glance]/auth_strategy`` is deprecated
    and will be ignored in the Rocky release.
    Instead, to setup glance in noauth mode set ``[glance]/auth_type``
    configuration option to ``none`` and provide glance API address as
    ``[glance]/endpoint_override`` configuration option.
