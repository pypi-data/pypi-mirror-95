    Fixes a misunderstanding in how DHCPv6 booting of machines operates
    in that only a URL to the boot loader is expected in that case, as opposed
    to traditional TFTP parameters. Now a URL is sent to the client in the form
    of ``tftp://<tftp_address>/<tftp_path>/<boot_file>``. See
    `story 1744620 <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/1744620>`_
    for more information.
