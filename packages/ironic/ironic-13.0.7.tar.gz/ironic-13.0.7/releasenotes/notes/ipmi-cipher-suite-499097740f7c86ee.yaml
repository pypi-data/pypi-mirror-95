    Allows configuring IPMI cipher suite via the new ``driver_info``
    parameter ``ipmi_cipher_suite`` to enable operators to navigate
    ``ipmitool`` behavior changes around supported ciphers.
issues:
  - Some ``ipmitool`` builds, in particular on machines running
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2, have changed the default cipher suite
    being offered which can cause ``ipmitool`` to completely fail to
    negotiate a connection with the BMC. Operators who encounter this
    situation should use the ``ipmi_cipher_suite`` parameter in the
    ``driver_info`` field to override and directly assert the required
    cipher. Because of potential security implications of attempting
    second level auto-negotiation and known BMC vendor behaviors,
    this must be identified by the operator and explicitly set as
    logic to attempt to navigate through situations like this may
    have undesirable results.
