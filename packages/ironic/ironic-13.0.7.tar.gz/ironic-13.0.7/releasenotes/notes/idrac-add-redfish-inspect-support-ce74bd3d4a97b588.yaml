    Adds ``idrac`` hardware type support of an inspect interface
    implementation that utilizes the Redfish out-of-band (OOB)
    management protocol and is compatible with the integrated Dell
    Remote Access Controller (iDRAC) baseboard management controller
    (BMC). It is named ``idrac-redfish``.

    The ``idrac`` hardware type declares support for that new interface
    implementation, in addition to all inspect interface implementations
    it has been supporting. The highest priority inspect interfaces
    remain the same, those which rely on the Web Services Management
    (WS-Man) OOB management protocol. The new 'idrac-redfish'
    immediately follows those. It now supports the following inspect
    interface implementations, listed in priority order from highest to
    lowest: ``idrac-wsman``, ``idrac``, ``idrac-redfish``,
    ``inspector``, and ``no-inspect``.
