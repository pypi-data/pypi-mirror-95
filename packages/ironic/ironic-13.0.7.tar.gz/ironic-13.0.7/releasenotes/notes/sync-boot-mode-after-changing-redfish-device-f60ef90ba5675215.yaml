    After changing the boot device via Redfish, check that the boot mode being
    reported matches what is configured and, if not, set it to the configured
    value.  Some BMCs change the boot mode when the device is
    set via Redfish, see `story 2008252
    <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2008252>`__ for details.
