upgrade:
  - |
    The Cisco ``cisco-ucs-managed`` and ``cisco-ucs-standalone`` hardware types
    and ``cimc`` and ``ucsm`` hardware interfaces which were deprecated in
    the 12.1.0 release have now been removed.

    After upgrading, if any of these hardware types or interfaces are specified
    in ironic's configuration options, the ironic-conductor service will fail
    to start. Any existing ironic nodes with these hardware types or interfaces
    will become inoperational via ironic after the upgrade. If these
    hardware types or interfaces are being used, the affected nodes should be
    changed to use other hardware types or interfaces; or install these hardware
    types (and interfaces) from elsewhere separately. For more information, see
    `story 2005033 <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2005033>`_.
