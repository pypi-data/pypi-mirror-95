fixes:
  - Fixes an issue where the socat process would exit on client disconnect,
    which would (a) leave a zombie socat process in the process table and (b)
    disable any subsequent serial console connections. This issue was
    addressed by updating ironic to call socat with the
    ``fork,max-children=1`` options, which makes socat persist and accept
    multiple connections (but only one at a time).
