    To facilitate automatic discovery of services from the service catalog,
    the configuration file sections for service clients may include these
    configuration options: ``service_type``, ``service_name``,
    ``valid_interfaces``, ``region_name`` and other keystoneauth options.

    These options together must uniquely specify an endpoint for a service
    registered in the service catalog. Alternatively, the ``endpoint_override``
    option can be used to specify the endpoint.

    Consult the `keystoneauth library documentation
    <https://docs.openstack.org/keystoneauth/latest/>`_ for a full list of
    available options, their meaning and possible values.

    Default values for ``service_type`` are set by ironic to sane defaults
    based on required services and their entries in the `service types
    authority <https://service-types.openstack.org/service-types.json>`_.

    The ``valid_interfaces`` option defaults to ``['internal', 'public']``.

    The ``region_name`` option defaults to ``None`` and must be explicitly set
    for multi-regional setup for endpoint discovery to succeed.

    Currently only the ``[service_catalog]`` section supports these options.

deprecations:
  - |
    Configuration option ``[conductor]api_url`` is deprecated
    and will be removed in the Rocky release. Instead, use the
    ``[service_catalog]endpoint_override`` configuration option to set
    the Bare Metal API endpoint if its automatic discovery from the service
    catalog is not desired.

    This new option defaults to ``None`` and must be set explicitly if needed.
