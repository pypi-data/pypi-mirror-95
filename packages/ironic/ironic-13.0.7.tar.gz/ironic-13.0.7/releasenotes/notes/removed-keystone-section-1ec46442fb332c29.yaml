    Deprecated option ``[keystone]\region_name`` was removed and will be
    ignored.
    Instead use ``region_name`` option in other sections related to contacting
    other services (``[service_catalog]``, ``[cinder]``, ``[glance]``,
    ``[neutron]``, [``swift``] and ``[inspector]``).

    As the option ``[keystone]\region_name`` was the only option in
    ``[keystone]`` section of ironic configuration file, this section was
    removed as well.
