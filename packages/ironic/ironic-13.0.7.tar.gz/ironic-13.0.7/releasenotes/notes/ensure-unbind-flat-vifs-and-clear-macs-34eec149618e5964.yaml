    Fixes an issue where Neutron ports would be left with a baremetal MAC
    address associated after an instance is deleted from a baremetal host. This
    caused problems with MAC address conflicts in follow up deployments to the
    same baremetal host. `bug 2004428

    Fixes an issue where a flat Neutron port would be left with a host ID
    associated with it after an instance is deleted from a baremetal host. This
    caused problems with reusing the same port for a new instance as it is
    already bound to the old instance.
