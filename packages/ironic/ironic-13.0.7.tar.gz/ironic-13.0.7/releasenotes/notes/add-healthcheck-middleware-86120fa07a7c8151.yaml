    Adds the healthcheck middleware from oslo, configurable via the
    ``[healthcheck]/enabled`` option. This middleware adds a status check at
    `/healthcheck`. This is useful for load balancers to determine if a service
    is up (and add or remove it from rotation), or for monitoring tools to see
    the health of the server. This endpoint is unauthenticated, as not all load
    balancers or monitoring tools support authenticating with a health check
    endpoint.
