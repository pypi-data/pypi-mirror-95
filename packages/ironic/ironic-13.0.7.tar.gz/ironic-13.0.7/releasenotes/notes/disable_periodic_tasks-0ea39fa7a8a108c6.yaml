    Setting these configuration options to 0 will disable the periodic tasks:

    * [conductor]sync_power_state_interval: sync power states for the nodes
    * [conductor]check_provision_state_interval:

      * check deployments and time out if the deployment takes too long
      * check the status of cleaning a node and time out if it takes too long
      * check the status of inspecting a node and time out if it takes too long
      * check for and handle nodes that are taken over by new conductors (if an
        old conductor disappeared)

    * [conductor]send_sensor_data_interval: send sensor data to ceilometer
    * [conductor]sync_local_state_interval: refresh a conductor's copy of the
      consistent hash ring. If any mappings have changed, determines which,
      if any, nodes need to be "taken over". The ensuing actions could include
      preparing a PXE environment, updating the DHCP server, and so on.
    * [oneview]periodic_check_interval:

      * check for nodes taken over by OneView users
      * check for nodes freed by OneView users

    Fixes an issue where setting these configuration options to 0 caused a
    ValueError exception to be raised. You can now set them to 0 to disable the
    associated periodic tasks. (For more information, see `story 2002059
    <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2002059>`_.):
