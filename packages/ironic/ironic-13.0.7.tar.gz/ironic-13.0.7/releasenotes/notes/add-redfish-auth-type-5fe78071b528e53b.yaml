    Adds the ``[redfish]auth_type`` ironic configuration option for the
    ``redfish`` hardware type that is used to choose one of the following
    authentication methods:: ``basic``, ``session`` and ``auto``.
    The ``auto`` setting first tries ``session`` method and falls back to
    ``basic`` if session authentication is not supported by the Redfish BMC.
    The default is ``auto``. This configuration option can be overridden
    on a per-node basis by the ``driver_info/redfish_auth_type`` option.
