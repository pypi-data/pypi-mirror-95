    Add ``?detail=`` boolean query to the API list endpoints to provide a more
    RESTful alternative to the existing ``/nodes/detail`` and similar endpoints. The
    default is False. Now these API requests are possible:

    * ``/nodes?detail=True``
    * ``/ports?detail=True``
    * ``/chassis?detail=True``
    * ``/portgroups?detail=True``
