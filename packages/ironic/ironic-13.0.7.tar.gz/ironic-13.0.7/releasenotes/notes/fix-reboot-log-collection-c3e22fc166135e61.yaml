    Fixes an issue where if a failure occurs during deployment, the Bare Metal
    service could attempt to collect logs from a node that had been powered
    off. This would result in a number of failed attempts to collect the logs
    before failing the deployment.  See `bug 1732939
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/1732939>`_ for details.
