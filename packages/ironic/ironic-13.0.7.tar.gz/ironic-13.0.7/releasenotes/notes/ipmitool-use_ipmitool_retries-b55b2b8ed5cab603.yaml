features:

    Adds a new ``[ipmi]use_ipmitool_retries`` option. When set to
    ``True`` and timing is supported by ipmitool, the number of
    retries and command interval will be passed to ipmitool so
    that ipmitool will do the retries.  When set to ``False``,
    ironic will do the retries.  Default is ``True``.
issues:
  - |
    Some BMCs do not support the ``Channel Cipher Suites`` command
    that newer versions of ipmitool use.  These versions of
    ipmitool will resend this command for each ipmitool retry,
    resulting in long response times.  Setting
    ``[ipmi]use_ipmitool_retries`` to ``false`` will avoid this
    situation by implementing retries on the ironic level.
