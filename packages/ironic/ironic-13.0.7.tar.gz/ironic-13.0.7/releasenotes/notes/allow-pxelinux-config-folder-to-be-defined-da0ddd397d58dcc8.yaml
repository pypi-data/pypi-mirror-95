    Adds a new configuration option ``[pxe]pxe_config_subdir`` to allow
    operators to define the specific directory that may be used inside of
    ``/tftpboot`` or ``/httpboot`` for a boot loader to locate the
    configuration file for the node. This option defaults to ``pxelinux.cfg``
    which is the directory that the Syslinux `pxelinux.0` bootloader utilized.
    Operators may wish to change the directory name if they are using other boot
    loaders such as `GRUB` or `iPXE`.
