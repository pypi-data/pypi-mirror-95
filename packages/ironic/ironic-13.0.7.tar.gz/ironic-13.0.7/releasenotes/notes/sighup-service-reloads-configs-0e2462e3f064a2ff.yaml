    Issuing a SIGHUP (e.g. ``pkill -HUP ironic``) to an ironic-api or
    ironic-conductor service will cause the service to reload and use any
    changed values for *mutable* configuration options. The mutable
    configuration options are:

    * [DEFAULT]/debug
    * [DEFAULT]/log_config_append
    * [DEFAULT]/pin_release_version

    Mutable configuration options are indicated as such in the `sample configuration
    file <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/configuration/sample-config.html>`_
    by ``Note: This option can be changed without restarting``.

    A warning is logged for any changes to immutable configuration options.
