              - text: A DIEP (deep inferior epigastric perforators) flap is a type of breast
                    reconstruction in which blood vessels and the skin and fat connected to
                    them are removed from the lower abdomen and transferred to the chest to
                    reconstruct a breast after mastectomy without the sacrifice of any of
                    the abdominal muscles. The DIEP flap technique uses autologous tissue
                    for breast reconstruction; the lower abdomen skin and subcutaneous
                    fatty tissue allow an adequate texture for symmetric breast
                    reconstruction, reducing donor-site morbidity and giving a more natural
                    and realistic result.

                    of perforators flap. This will reduce intraoperative time and also reduce
                    complications related to poor perfurator selection.  Other methods of
                    perforator mapping include ultrasonography.

                    period. Regular surveillance to detect any signs of decreased blood flow should be
                    conducted every 15 minutes for the first 2 hours.  The flap should be monitored for
                    any changes of temperature and the blood flow assessed by ultrasound techniques,
                    detecting any complications before the flap changes in colour. The frequency of
                    monitoring is then changed to an hourly assessment to be kept until the first 24-72
                    hours.
