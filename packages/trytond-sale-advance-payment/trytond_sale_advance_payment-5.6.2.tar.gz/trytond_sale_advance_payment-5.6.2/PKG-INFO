Description: Sale Advance Payment Module
        ###########################
        
        The sale_advance_payment module adds support for advance payment management on
        the sale.
        
        The module adds a new document: the Advance Payment Term that defines how the
        shipment or the supply processes should be managed. Either process can be
        completely delayed until the advance payments are paid.
        
        Two new fields are added to *Sale*:
        
        - *Advance Payment Term*
        - *Advance Payment Conditions*
        
        The conditions are computed at the quotation of the sale if a payment term is
        set.
        
        When the sale is processed the advance payment invoices are created, final
        invoices will be generated when this advance payment invoices are paid. Those
        invoices will take into the account the amount previously paid by the customer.
        
        .. warning::
            If an advance payment invoice is cancelled and not recreated when
            processing the exception. The condition of the cancelled invoice will be
            concidered as met.
        ..
