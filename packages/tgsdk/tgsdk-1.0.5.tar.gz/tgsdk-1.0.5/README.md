# Telegram API SDK

## Introduction


## Getting started
To start using package tgsdk you have to know methods of the [Telegram API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api). This library provides pure  interface to interact with it, but you need to understand what you are doing.

Documentation of methods just contain URL to real [Telegram API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) documentation cause all logic is understandable without large texts and you have to know description and signature of most methods. If you want you can add documentation and make a pull request.

## Installation

```bash
pip install tgsdk --upgrade
```
