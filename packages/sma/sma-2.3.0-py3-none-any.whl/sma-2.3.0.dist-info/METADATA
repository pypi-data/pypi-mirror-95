# SESMotifAnalyser: framework for analysing social-ecological systems

This package contains a Python based framework for analysing social-ecological systems and more broadly multi-level networks.


## Documentation

**A comprehensive documentation is available [as PDF](https://gitlab.com/t.seppelt/sesmotifanalyser/raw/master/doc/_build/latex/SESMotifAnalyser.pdf?inline=false).**
Please contact t.seppelt-dev[Ã„T]posteo.de in case of any questions.

See the [examples folder](https://gitlab.com/t.seppelt/sesmotifanalyser/-/tree/master/examples) for examples.

## Installation

The package can be installed using ``pip``.

```bash
pip3 install sma
```

Per default, dependencies required for drawing social-ecological networks will not
be installed. The following command may be used to install the additional dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install sma[plots]
```

It has the following dependencies: Python 3, numpy, scipy, networkx, pandas.
On the R side it depends on statnet, reticulate (with Python 3).

For a version history, see [change log](https://gitlab.com/t.seppelt/sesmotifanalyser/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and [tags](https://gitlab.com/t.seppelt/sesmotifanalyser/-/tags).

## Integration in R and motifr <a href='https://marioangst.github.io/motifr/'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marioangst/motifr/master/man/figures/logo.svg' align="right" height="139" /></a>

The functions in this package can to some extent be called from R using the R package 
reticulate. An example can be found in the 
[examples folder](https://gitlab.com/t.seppelt/sesmotifanalyser/raw/master/examples/example.R). 
See also the corresponding section in the documentation.

Mario Angst is working on an R package which provides an interface to the SESMotifAnalyser. 
His project motifr can be found on [Github](https://marioangst.github.io/motifr/).


## ergm-userterms

In addition to the motif counting features written in Python, this repository contains `ergm-userterms` for some motifs, e.g. the 3-motifs I.C and II.C (closed and open triangles,
respecting the social-ecological types of the nodes).

After downloading and compiling the package, `ergm` models can be fitted and the motif counting
can be done directly in R:

```R
netw <- network(...)

# first parameter: which sesType should the nodes at the points of the triangles have
# second parameter: name of nodel attribute
summary(netw ~ openTriangles(0, 'sesType'))
```
