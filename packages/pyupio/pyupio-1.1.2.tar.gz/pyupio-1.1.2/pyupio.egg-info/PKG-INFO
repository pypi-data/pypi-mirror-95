        About
        -----
        
        This repo contains the bot that is running at pyup.io. You can install it locally and run the bot through the command line interface.
        
        Documentation: https://pyup.io/docs/
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install pyup, run::
        
            $ pip install pyupio
        
        If you want to update Pipfiles, install the optional pipenv extra:
        
            $ pip install dparse[pipenv]
        
        Obtain Token
        ------------
        
        In order to communicate with the github API, you need to create an oauth token for your account:
        
        * Log in to your github account
        * Click on settings -> Personal access tokens
        * Click on Generate new token
        * Make sure to check `repo` and `email` and click on Generate token
        
        Run your first Update
        ---------------------
        
        Run::
        
            $ pyup --repo=username/repo --user-token=<YOUR_TOKEN> --initial
        
        
        This will check all your requirement files and search for new package versions. If there are
        updates available, pyup will create a new branch on your repository and create a new commit for
        every single update. Once all files are up to date, pyup will create a single pull request containing
        all commits.
        
        Once your repository is up to date and the initial update is merged in, remove the `--initial`
        flag and run::
        
            $ pyup --repo=username/repo --user-token=<YOUR_TOKEN>
        
        This will create a new branch and a pull request for every single update. Run a cronjob or a scheduled task somewhere
        that auto-updates your repository once in a while (e.g. every day) to stay on latest.
        
        
        Pyup also has experimental support for Gitlab.  Generate a personal access token
        from your profile settings (eg. https://gitlab.com/profile/personal_access_tokens),
        then run pyup from the cli::
        
            # gitlab.com:
            $ pyup --provider gitlab --repo=username/repo --user-token=<YOUR_TOKEN>
        
        Custom Gitlab instance and GitHub Enterprise support
        ----------------------------------------------------
        
        Pyup offer support for custom Gitlab instances and GitHub Enterprise via the provider_url option::
        
            $ pyup --provider github --provider_url https://github.enterprise/api/v3 --repo=username/repo --user-token=<YOUR_TOKEN>
            $ pyup --provider gitlab --provider_url https://your.gitlab/ --repo=username/repo --user-token=<YOUR_TOKEN>
        
            # The alternative method to add a custom gitlab instance is still valid :
            $ pyup --provider gitlab --repo=username/repo --user-token=<YOUR_TOKEN>@https://your.gitlab/
        
        
        Disable verification of SSL certificate::
        
            $ pyup --provider github --provider_url https://github.enterprise/api/v3 --repo=username/repo --user-token=<YOUR_TOKEN> --ignore_ssl
            $ pyup --provider gitlab --repo=username/repo --user-token=<YOUR_TOKEN>@https://your.gitlab/ --ignore_ssl
        
        Python 2.7
        ----------
        
        This tool requires latest Python patch versions starting with version 3.5. We
        did support Python 2.7 in the past but, as for other Python 3.x minor versions,
        it reached its End-Of-Life and as such we are not able to support it anymore.
        
        We understand you might still have Python 2.7 projects running. At the same
        time, PyUp itself has a commitment to encourage developers to keep their
        software up-to-date, and it would not make sense for us to work with officially
        unsupported Python versions, or even those that reached their end of life.
        
        If you still need to run PyUp from a Python 2.7 environment, please use
        version 1.0.2 available at PyPi. Alternatively, you can run PyUp from a
        Python 3 environment to check the requirements file for your Python 2.7
        project.
        
        
        
        
        History
        -------
        
        1.1.2 (2021-02-19)
        -------------------
        * Schedule wont break config reading if it is not a string
        * New feature `#274`_ allows customizing commit messages
        * Fixed `#384`_ affecting GitLab automatic merge
        
        .. _#274: https://github.com/pyupio/pyup/issues/274
        .. _#384: https://github.com/pyupio/pyup/issues/384
        
        1.1.1 (2020-05-01)
        ------------------
        * Fixed package Python requirement metadata to Python 3.5+
        * Added an option to ignore SSL certificate
        * GitLab integration minor fixes
        * Upgraded Dparse and Safety requirement
        * Fixed `#343`_ affecting Cookiecutter projects
        * Fixed `#348`_ affecting GitLab branch removal
        
        .. _#343: https://github.com/pyupio/pyup/issues/343

        -----------------
        
        This version does not contain, as it was supposed to, the metadata setting
        minimum Python requirement to 3.5. That means you might still get this while
        setting up this package from a Python 2.7. If that is the case, make sure you
        are using version 1.0.3 instead. If you are running from a Python 3 environment
        this should not be an issue.
        
        * Dropped Python 2.7 and other EOL versions
        * Dropped PyPy support
        * Removed unused and dev requirements

        * Fix for GitHub empty commit error message #329
        * Fix use of deprecated assertEquals() in tests #324
        * Make schedules case-insensitive #320
        * Improve Gitlab integration #314
        * Add provider_url option and support for GitHub Enterprise #301
