1.1.0 (2020-3-14)
-----------------

This version does not contain, as it was supposed to, the metadata setting
minimum Python requirement to 3.5. That means you might still get this while
setting up this package from a Python 2.7. If that is the case, make sure you
are using version 1.0.3 instead. If you are running from a Python 3 environment
