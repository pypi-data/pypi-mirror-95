        # Amphetype
        
        Amphetype is an advanced typing practice program.
        
        Features include:
        
        * Type your favorite novel!
        
          One of the core ideas behind Amphetype was to not just use boring
          "stock texts" for typing practice, but to allow me to practice on
          texts that I actually want to read. So one feature is the ability to
          import whole novels (for example from [Project
          Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/)) and have Amphetype
          automatically generate bite-sized lessons from the text. For
          example, when I was learning the [Colemak](https://colemak.com/)
          keyboard layout, I typed _The Metamorphosis_ by Franz Kafka!
          
        * Typing statistics.
        
          It provides the basic typing statistics (accuracy and WPM) across
          keys, trigrams, and words. It also tries to identify parts that
          break your flow and what impact these "viscous" combinations have on
          your typing speed overall. It also shows a graphs of progress over
          time.
          
        * Generate lessons from past statistics.
        
          Amphetype features an advanced lesson generator where you can
          generate texts based on your past performance. Generate blocks of
          text to target practice your slowest words, trigrams, or keys!
        
        * Layout-agnostic.
        
          Amphetype doesn't care _what_ keyboard or layout you use, it only
          looks at _how_ you use it.
        
        * Highly customizable in functionality, looks, and feel.
        
        # Installing
        
        ## GNU/Linux
        
        Install via pip:
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install --user amphetype
        ```
        
        Note that Amphetype requires Python 3.6+.
        
        ## Windows
        
        Check out the releases for an installer.
        
        ## MacOS
        
        Here I will pretty much just copy instructions out of Google, because
        I have no experience with OSX.
        
        (If you're an experienced user, the Linux instructions above
        are probably enough.)
        
        1. First install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
        2. Then (still in a terminal) install Python 3:
           ```bash
           $ brew install python
           ```
        3. Hopefully you will now have a command called `pip` (or `pip3`?), so
           use that like in the Linux instructions. If it doesn't work, try something like this:
           ```bash
           $ python3 -m pip install amphetype
           ```
        4. Run the program:
           ```bash
           $ amphetype
           ```
           (Might also work to find it with Finder? I don't really know.)
        
        # Resurrected?
        
        Yes, I originally made this program 12 years ago
        [here](https://code.google.com/archive/p/amphetype/). I've updated it
        somewhat and implemented some features that were requested back then,
        and upgraded the code to use Python 3 and Qt5 (instead of Python 2 and
        Qt4).
        
        Google Code has gone read-only though, so I am unable to do anything
        about what's shown there.
