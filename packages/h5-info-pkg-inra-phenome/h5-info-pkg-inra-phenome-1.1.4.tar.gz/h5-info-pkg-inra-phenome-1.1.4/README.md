# H5Info Package

This Python package contains the necessary tools to extract data and metadata from HDF5 files generated by Phenomobile acquisition in the context of the Phenome project by INRA, France.

The API of the H5Info package exposes 3 methods:

- ``load_data()``: to extract data from a HDF5 file and store it into a H5Info structure
- ``save_metadata()``: to save a H5Info metadata structure into a JSON  file
- ``load_metadata()``: to load a H5Info metadata structure from a JSON file

Please refer to the ``main.py`` script for an example about how to use these three methods.

## Install H5Info module

The H5Info module is deployed on PyPi (Python Package Index) under the name [h5-info-pkg-inra-phenome](https://pypi.org/project/h5-info-pkg-inra-phenome/).

To install the H5Info module on your local environment, just run the following command:

``pip install h5-info-pkg-inra-phenome``

## H5Info Structure Example

``h5_info = H5Info()``

### Session

- ``h5_info.session.date = 2020-02-03_09:45:23``
- ``h5_info.session.experiment_id = "2019_SunRise"``
- ``h5_info.session.experiment_uri = "http://www.phenome-fppn.fr/diaphen/2019/v1901"``
- ``h5_info.session.local_infra = "Diaphen"``
- ``h5_info.session.national_infra = "PHENOME"``

### Plot

- ``h5_info.plot.id = "20LP4_129_8_1039"``
- ``h5_info.plot.uri = "http://www.phenome-fppn.fr/diaphen/2018/v1801"``
- ``h5_info.plot.coordinates = [[1.5015271931087, 43.532682695713], [1.5015062032854, 43.532676540606], [1.5014877113578, 43.532709920144], [1.5015087011914, 43.532716075254]]``
- ``h5_info.plot.orientation = 158.04785481961858``

### Vector

- ``h5_info.vector.id = "Phenomobile V2"``
- ``h5_info.vector.uri = "http://www.phenome-fppn.fr/diaphen/2018/v1801"``
- ``h5_info.vector.serial_nb = "PHENOMOBILE_V2_01"``

### Sensors

``for sensor in h5_info.sensors:``

- ``sensor.id = "4"``
- ``sensor.type = "camera"``
- ``sensor.description = "camera_1"``
- ``sensor.manufacturer = "Baumer"``
- ``sensor.model = "VLG 40C"``
- ``sensor.serial_nb = "00_06_be_01_62_f0"``
- ``sensor.uri = "http://www.phenome-fppn.fr/agrophen/2019/s19003"``

### Image

``for image in sensor:``

- ``image.name = "camera_1_1"``
- ``image.date = 2019-06-04_12:11:52.316072``

Camera, Multispectral and Lidar images have also their own specific attributes.

### Others fields

The H5Info structure contains other fields not detailed here, such as the ``vector position``, each ``sensor positions`` and ``static transforms`` factors. In addition, a geolocalisation file containing positions of the head is saved in a separate file named ``geo.csv``
