# arvo
A python library for procedural music composition, based on the music21 (https://github.com/cuthbertLab/music21) framework, created and maintained by Dr. Georges Dimitrov, composition professor at Concordia University (https://www.concordia.ca/finearts/music.html).

### Modules
This library currently contains the following core modules:

* **Minimalism**: Functions for generating Philip Glass/Steve Reich-inspired additive and substractive processes.
* **Transformations**: Functions for doing scalar transpositions and inversions.
* **Tintinnabuli**: Functions for generating Arvo PÃ¤rt-inspired tintinnabuli.
* **Isorhythm**: Functions for generating isorhythmic constructions from pitch and rhythm sequences.

It also contains the following helper modules:
* **Sequences**: Useful integer sequences for music composition, like primes, fibonacci, kolakoski...
* **Scales**: Extension of music21 scales system with some common/useful scales.
* **Tools**: Convenient helper functions for quickly manipulating and combining music21 elements.
