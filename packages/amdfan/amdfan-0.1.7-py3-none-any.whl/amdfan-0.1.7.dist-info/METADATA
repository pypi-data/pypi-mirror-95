# AmdFan
![Python package](https://github.com/mcgillij/amdfan/workflows/Python%20package/badge.svg)

Is a fork of amdgpu-fan, with security updates and added functionality.

## Why fork?

* alternatives abandoned
* lacking required features
* security fixes not addressed
* basic functionality not working 

### Amdgpu_fan abandoned

As of a couple years ago, and isn’t applying any security fixes to their project or improvements. There were also some bugs that bothered me with the project when I tried to get it up and running.
Features missing

There are a number of features that I wanted, but weren’t available.

* Thresholds allow temperature range before changing fan speed
* Frequency setting to allow better control
* Monitoring to be able to see real-time fan speeds and temperature 

### Security Fixes

There are some un-addressed pull requests for some recent YAML vulnerabilities that are still present in the old amdgpu_fan project, that I’ve addressed in this fork.

### Basic functionality

Setting the card to system managed using the amdgpu_fan pegs your GPU fan at 100%, instead of allowing the system to manage the fan settings. I fixed that bug as well in this release.

These are all addressed in Amdfan, and as long as I’ve still got some AMD cards I intend to at least maintain this for myself. And anyone’s able to help out since this is open source. I would have liked to just contribute these fixes to the main project, but it’s now inactive.

# Documentation
## Usage

``` bash
Usage: amdfan.py [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --daemon         Run as daemon applying the fan curve
  --monitor        Run as a monitor showing temp and fan speed
  --manual         Manually set the fan speed value of a card
  --configuration  Prints out the default configuration for you to use
  --service        Prints out the amdfan.service file to use with systemd
  --help           Show this message and exit.
```

## Daemon

Amdfan is also runnable as a systemd service, with the provided ```amdfan.service```.

## Monitor

You can use Amdfan to monitor your AMD video cards using the ```--monitor``` flag.

## Manual

Alternatively if you don't want to set a fan curve, you can just apply a fan setting manually. 
Also allows you to revert the fan control to the systems default behavior by using the "auto" parameter.

## Configuration

This will dump out the default configuration that would get generated for `/etc/amdfan.yml` when you first run it as a service. This allows you to configure the settings prior to running it as a daemon if you wish.

Running `amdfan --configuration` will output the following block to STDOUT.

``` bash
#Fan Control Matrix.
# [<Temp in C>,<Fanspeed in %>]
speed_matrix:
- [4, 4]
- [30, 33]
- [45, 50]
- [60, 66]
- [65, 69]
- [70, 75]
- [75, 89]
- [80, 100]

# Current Min supported value is 4 due to driver bug
#
# Optional configuration options
#
# Allows for some leeway +/- temp, as to not constantly change fan speed
# threshold: 4
#
# Frequency will change how often we probe for the temp
# frequency: 5
#
# While frequency and threshold are optional, I highly recommend finding
# settings that work for you. I've included the defaults I use above.
#
# cards:
# can be any card returned from `ls /sys/class/drm | grep "^card[[:digit:]]$"`
# - card0
```
You can use this to generate your configuration by doing ``amdfan --configuration > amdfan.yml``, you can then modify the settings and place it in ``/etc/amdfan.yml`` for when you would like to run it as a service.

## Service

This is just a convenience method for dumping out the `amdfan.service` that would get installed if you used a package manager to install amdfan. Useful if you installed the module via `pip`, `pipenv` or `poetry`.

Running `amdfan --service` will output the following block to STDOUT.

``` bash
[Unit]
Description=amdfan controller

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/amdfan --daemon
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

# Note

Monitoring fan speeds and temperatures can run with regular user permissions.
`root` permissions are required for changing the settings / running as a daemon.

# Recommended settings

Below is the settings that I use on my machines to control the fan curve without too much fuss, but you should find a frequency and threshold setting that works for your workloads.

`/etc/amdfan.yml`
``` bash
speed_matrix:
- [4, 4]
- [30, 33]
- [45, 50]
- [60, 66]
- [65, 69]
- [70, 75]
- [75, 89]
- [80, 100]

threshold: 4
frequency: 5
```

## Installing the systemd service
If you installed via the AUR, the service is already installed, and you just need to *start/enable* it. If you installed via pip/pipenv or poetry, you can generate your systemd service file with the following command.

``` bash
amdfan --service > amdfan.service && sudo mv amdfan.service /usr/lib/systemd/system/
```

## Starting the systemd service

To run the service, you can run the following commands to **start/enable** the service.

``` bash
sudo systemctl start amdfan
sudo systemctl enable amdfan
```

After you've started it, you may want to edit the settings found in `/etc/amdfan.yml`. Once your happy with those, you can restart amdfan with the following command.

``` bash
sudo systemctl restart amdfan
```

## Checking the status
You can check the systemd service status with the following command:

``` bash
systemctl status amdfan
```


## Building Arch AUR package

Building the Arch package assumes you already have a chroot env setup to build packages.

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/amdfan.git
cd amdfan/
makechrootpkg -c -r $HOME/$CHROOT
```

## Installing the Arch package

``` bash
sudo pacman -U --asdeps amdfan-*-any.pkg.tar.zst
```

# Installing from PyPi
You can also install amdfan from pypi using something like poetry.

``` bash
poetry init
poetry add amdfan
poetry run amdfan --help
```

# Building Python package
Requires [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to be installed

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:mcgillij/amdfan.git
cd amdfan/
poetry build
```
