The AEA `erc1155_deploy` and `erc1155_client` skills demonstrate an interaction between two AEAs with the usage of a smart contract.

* The `erc1155_deploy` skill deploys the smart contract, creates and mints items. 
* The `erc1155_client` skill signs a transaction to complete a trustless trade with the counterparty.

## Preparation instructions
 
### Dependencies

Follow the <a href="../quickstart/#preliminaries">Preliminaries</a> and <a href="../quickstart/#installation">Installation</a> sections from the AEA quick start.

## Discussion

The scope of the specific demo is to demonstrate how to deploy a smart contract and interact with it. For the specific use-case, we create two AEAs one that deploys and creates tokens inside the smart contract and the other that signs a transaction so we can complete an atomic swap. The smart contract we are using is an ERC1155 smart contract
with a one-step atomic swap functionality. That means the trade between the two AEAs can be trustless.

<div class="admonition note">
  <p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
  <p>This demo serves demonstrative purposes only. Since the AEA deploying the contract also has the ability to mint tokens, in reality the transfer of tokens from the AEA signing the transaction is worthless.</p>
</div>

## Demo

### Create the deployer AEA

Fetch the AEA that will deploy the contract.

``` bash
aea fetch fetchai/erc1155_deployer:0.24.0
cd erc1155_deployer
aea install
aea build
```

<details><summary>Alternatively, create from scratch.</summary>
<p>

Create the AEA that will deploy the contract.

``` bash
aea create erc1155_deployer
cd erc1155_deployer
aea add connection fetchai/p2p_libp2p:0.16.0
aea add connection fetchai/soef:0.17.0
aea add connection fetchai/ledger:0.13.0
aea add skill fetchai/erc1155_deploy:0.22.0
aea install
aea build
aea config set agent.default_connection fetchai/p2p_libp2p:0.16.0
aea config set --type dict agent.default_routing \
'{
  "fetchai/contract_api:0.11.0": "fetchai/ledger:0.13.0",
  "fetchai/ledger_api:0.10.0": "fetchai/ledger:0.13.0",
  "fetchai/oef_search:0.13.0": "fetchai/soef:0.17.0"
}'
aea config set --type list vendor.fetchai.connections.p2p_libp2p.cert_requests \
'[{"identifier": "acn", "ledger_id": "ethereum", "not_after": "2022-01-01", "not_before": "2021-01-01", "public_key": "fetchai", "save_path": ".certs/conn_cert.txt"}]'
```

And change the default ledger:
``` bash
aea config set agent.default_ledger ethereum
```

</p>
</details>

Additionally, create the private key for the deployer AEA. Generate and add a key for Ethereum use:
``` bash
aea generate-key ethereum
aea add-key ethereum ethereum_private_key.txt
```

And one for the P2P connection:
``` bash
aea generate-key fetchai fetchai_connection_private_key.txt
aea add-key fetchai fetchai_connection_private_key.txt --connection
```

Finally, certify the key for use by the connections that request that:
``` bash
aea issue-certificates
```

### Create the client AEA

In another terminal, fetch the AEA that will get some tokens from the deployer.

``` bash
aea fetch fetchai/erc1155_client:0.24.0
cd erc1155_client
aea install
aea build
```

<details><summary>Alternatively, create from scratch.</summary>
<p>

Create the AEA that will get some tokens from the deployer.

``` bash
aea create erc1155_client
cd erc1155_client
aea add connection fetchai/p2p_libp2p:0.16.0
aea add connection fetchai/soef:0.17.0
aea add connection fetchai/ledger:0.13.0
aea add skill fetchai/erc1155_client:0.21.0
aea install
aea build
aea config set agent.default_connection fetchai/p2p_libp2p:0.16.0
aea config set --type dict agent.default_routing \
'{
  "fetchai/contract_api:0.11.0": "fetchai/ledger:0.13.0",
  "fetchai/ledger_api:0.10.0": "fetchai/ledger:0.13.0",
  "fetchai/oef_search:0.13.0": "fetchai/soef:0.17.0"
}'
aea config set --type list vendor.fetchai.connections.p2p_libp2p.cert_requests \
'[{"identifier": "acn", "ledger_id": "ethereum", "not_after": "2022-01-01", "not_before": "2021-01-01", "public_key": "fetchai", "save_path": ".certs/conn_cert.txt"}]'
```

And change the default ledger:
``` bash
aea config set agent.default_ledger ethereum
```

</p>
</details>

Additionally, create the private key for the client AEA. Generate and add a key for Ethereum use:
``` bash
aea generate-key ethereum
aea add-key ethereum ethereum_private_key.txt
```

And one for the P2P connection:
``` bash
aea generate-key fetchai fetchai_connection_private_key.txt
aea add-key fetchai fetchai_connection_private_key.txt --connection
```

Finally, certify the key for use by the connections that request that:
``` bash
aea issue-certificates
```

## Run Ganache

Run the following command
``` bash
docker run -p 8545:8545 trufflesuite/ganache-cli:latest --verbose --gasPrice=0 --gasLimit=0x1fffffffffffff --account="$(cat erc1155_deployer/ethereum_private_key.txt),1000000000000000000000" --account="$(cat erc1155_client/ethereum_private_key.txt),1000000000000000000000"
```

To check the wealth use (after some time for the wealth creation to be mined on Ropsten):

``` bash
aea get-wealth ethereum
```

You should get `1000000000000000000000`.

<div class="admonition note">
  <p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
  <p>If no wealth appears after a while, then try funding the private key directly using a web faucet.</p>
</div>


## Update SOEF configurations for both AEAs

To update the SOEF configuration, run in each AEA project:
``` bash
aea config set vendor.fetchai.connections.soef.config.chain_identifier ethereum
```

## Run the AEAs

First, run the deployer AEA.

``` bash 
aea run
```

Once you see a message of the form `To join its network use multiaddr 'SOME_ADDRESS'` take note of the address.

It will perform the following steps:
- deploy the smart contract
- create a batch of items in the smart contract
- mint a batch of items in the smart contract

At some point you should see the log output:
``` bash
registering service on SOEF.
```

Then, update the configuration of the client AEA's P2P connection by appending the following
YAML text at the end of the `aea-config.yaml` file:

``` yaml
---
public_id: fetchai/p2p_libp2p:0.16.0
type: connection
config:
  delegate_uri: 127.0.0.1:11001
  entry_peers:
  - SOME_ADDRESS
  local_uri: 127.0.0.1:9001
  log_file: libp2p_node.log
  public_uri: 127.0.0.1:9001
```

where `SOME_ADDRESS` is the output
of `aea get-multiaddress fetchai -c -i fetchai/p2p_libp2p:0.16.0 -u public_uri)` in the `erc1155_deployer` project.
The output will be something like `/dns4/127.0.0.1/tcp/9000/p2p/16Uiu2HAm2JPsUX1Su59YVDXJQizYkNSe8JCusqRpLeeTbvY76fE5`.


Or, run these commands (replace `SOME_ADDRESS` as above):
``` bash
aea config set --type dict vendor.fetchai.connections.p2p_libp2p.config \
'{
  "delegate_uri": "127.0.0.1:11001",
  "entry_peers": ["SOME_ADDRESS"],
  "local_uri": "127.0.0.1:9001",
  "log_file": "libp2p_node.log",
  "public_uri": "127.0.0.1:9001"
}'
```

Then, in the separate terminal run the client AEA.

``` bash 
aea run
```

You will see that upon discovery the two AEAs exchange information about the transaction and the client at the end signs and sends the signature to the deployer AEA to send it to the network.

<div class="admonition note">
  <p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
  <p>Transactions on Ropsten can take a significant amount of time! If you run the example a second time, and the previous transaction is still pending, it can lead to a failure.

  The warning message `Cannot verify whether transaction improves utility. Assuming it does!` can be ignored.
  </p>
</div>

## Delete the AEAs

When you're done, go up a level and delete the AEAs.
``` bash 
cd ..
aea delete erc1155_deployer
aea delete erc1155_client
```
