## String Theory

But this foundational principle of science has now been called into question by [String Theory](https://www.britannica.com/science/string-theory), which is a relative newcomer to theoretical physics, but one that has captured the common imagination, judging by the popular explanations that abound on the Web [@mann2019; @wood2019; @jones2020]. And whether string theory is or is not science, Popper notwithstanding, is an issue that is still up for debate [@siegel2015; @castelvecchi2016; @alves2017; @francis2019].
