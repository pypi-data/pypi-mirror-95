# gg-scrape
A little Python CLI app that provides a League of Legends champion build by scraping the web.

The goal was to not have to open a browser tab (or be advertised to) to quickly check a build before a match.
The HTML is requested and parsed sequentially, so it's somewhat slow (but still faster than opening a browser).

## Installation
```
python -m pip install gg-scrape
```

## Usage
```
ggs [OPTIONS] CHAMPION [ROLE]
```

## Requirements
