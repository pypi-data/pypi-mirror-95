# Workflow of the included templates:
#
# 1) Unless pipeline is triggered by a tag, this project will be linted
#    with pylint and a pylint-score-badge is generated.
#
# 2) This pipeline will always build this project and store it as artifact.
#
# 3) Unless triggered via tag, a semantic release will be generated.
#    If current branch is not main aka a protected branch,
#    semantc-release does only a dry-run.
#
# 4) If triggered via tag, build will be released with twine
#
# Templates/Includes located and documented here:
