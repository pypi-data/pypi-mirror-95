 PlonePAS is released under the ZPL2.1

 much of the code in PlonePAS is destined for pluggableauthservice in
 zope corp cvs (upstream) and Plone proper. due to the licensing and
 copyright differences between these two organizations i've set the
 copyright to myself as the principal author in the interim to avoid
 any legal hassles.
