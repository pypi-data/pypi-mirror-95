 can an ldap connection determine if it has r/w based on its
 configuration.. is there a simpel test. its hier perms on a hier,
 ... hmmm... probably we need a user option here.


 its even harder that for a generic case, in that a particular user
 may or may not be able to handle properties....

 so really we want to take it out of the plugin system, and just use
 interface to define api/marker on a dynamic return value from the
 prop interface.
