# Pymagnet

User friendly magnetic field calculations in Python

## Calculating Magnetic Fields and Forces

Forms of this library have been used in a number of projects including [Liquid flow and control without solid walls, Nature 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2254-4).

## Features

This code uses analytical expressions to calculate the magnetic field due to
simple magnets. These include:

* 3D objects: cubes, cuboids, cylinders
* 2D: rectangles, squares

There are helper functions to plot the data as either line or countour plots,
but the underlying data is also accessible.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Python](https://www.anaconda.com/) version >= 3.6
 (to use f-strings), and the following packages:

* numpy
* matplotlib

## Partial TODOs

* Implement arbitrary orientation in public code
* 3D rendering of slices
