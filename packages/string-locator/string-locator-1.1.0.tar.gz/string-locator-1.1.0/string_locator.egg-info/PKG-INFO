Description: # String Locator
        
        A simple code to find the file containing a given string inside a given path.
        
        At times in the programming world, we might need to change a certain code but don't know which file it is in and might have to go through a huge list of files. The string locator helps the user find the desired file by entering the text and the path to the folder containing all the documents.
        
        
        
        ## Code
        
        ```
        from string_locator import locator
        
        text='import tensorflow'
        path='C:/Users/admin/Desktop/test_folder
        
        location=locator.locate(text,path)
        
        ```
