# QPlanarity

QPlanarity is a little puzzle game about untangling graphs.

If you love the meditative feeling of jigsaw puzzles, then you might
like this game. It's a relaxation game, a stress relief kind of thing.
Feels great to make everything neat and planar.

# Installing

Use `pip` or `pip3`:

    $ pip install qplanarity

This should install a script/app/whatever called qplanarity.

# Tips

- Right click nodes (the circles) to "nudge" its connected neighbors
  toward it. Useful for large graphs where nodes overlap a lot.
- The state of the graph is saved on exit, so you shouldn't lose any
  progress.
- Try to weave the tangled mess into a pattern of little triangles if
  you lose track of what's going on.
- A solution is /always/ possible.
