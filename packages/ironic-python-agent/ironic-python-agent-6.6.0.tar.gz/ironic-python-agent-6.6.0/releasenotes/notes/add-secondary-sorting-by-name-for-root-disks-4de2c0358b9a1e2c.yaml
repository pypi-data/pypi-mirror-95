    Adds secondary sorting by device name when guessing the root disk. This
    makes the selection process more predictable and increases the chances
    that systems which try only one device for booting will actually
    successfully boot after deployment. As the primary sorting is still done
    by size, the root device hints still take priority, and the current
    behaviour is basically not specifying the order beyond size, this change
    does not break backwards compatibility.
