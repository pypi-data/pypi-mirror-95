    Fixes cleaning operations when floppy disk devices are present on the
    baremetal node. Floppy disk devices are now explicitly ignored.

  - |
    The default ``list_all_block_devices`` hardware manager method has been
    changed to ignore floppy disk devices, introducing an argument
    ``ignore_floppy`` with a default value of ``True``.
    A value of ``False`` may be passed to the ``list_all_block_devices``
    method to include such devices.
