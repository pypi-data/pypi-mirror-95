    If a PReP boot partition is created, and the machine being deployed to is
    of ppc64le architecture, the grub2 bootloader will be installed directly
    there. This enables booting partition images locally on ppc64* hardware.

    Using this feature requires ``ironic-lib`` version 2.14 as support to
    create the PReP partition was introduced there.
