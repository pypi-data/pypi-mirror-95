    Adds an explicit capture of connectivity failures in the heartbeat
    process to provide a more verbose error message in line with what is
    occuring as opposed to just indicating that an error occured. This
    new exception is called ``HeartbeatConnectionError`` and is likely only
    going to be visible if there is a local connectivity failure such as a
    router failure, switchport in a blocking state, or connection centered
    transient failure.
