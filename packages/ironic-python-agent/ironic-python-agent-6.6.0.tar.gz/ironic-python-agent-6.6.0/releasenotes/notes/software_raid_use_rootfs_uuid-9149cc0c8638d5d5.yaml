    For Software RAID, the IPA will no longer assume that the root file system
    is in the first partition of the deployed image. Instead, the IPA will use
    the UUID passed from the conductor to identify the root partition. Before
    upgrades, the root file system UUID needs hence to be set as part of the
    node's ``driver_internal_info`` or as ``rootfs_uuid`` image metadata.
