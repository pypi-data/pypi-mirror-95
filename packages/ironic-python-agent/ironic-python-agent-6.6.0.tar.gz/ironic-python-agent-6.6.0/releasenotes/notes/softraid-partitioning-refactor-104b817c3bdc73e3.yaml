fixes:
  - Fixes size conversion when creating software RAID with ``size_gb``
    provided. From the `RAID documentation
    <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/raid.html#target-raid-configuration>`_
    ``size_gb`` unit is GiB but parted defaults to MB.
  - Fixes creating software RAID when several logical drives have a size
    specified (i.e not 'MAX'). See `story 2006352
    <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2006352>`_.
  - Fixes creating software RAID when a logical drive with size 'MAX' is not
    the last in the list of logical drives.
