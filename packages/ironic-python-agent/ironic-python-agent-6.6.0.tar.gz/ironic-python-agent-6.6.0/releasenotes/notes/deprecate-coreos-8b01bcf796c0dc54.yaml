    Ironic community provided CoreOS IPA images are deprecated. These images
    utilize contents that are injected into CoreOS images which utilize a
    chroot environment to enable full and unrestricted hardware access.

    This decision is not taken lightly, and is due to multiple constraints
    combined with technical changes over time as CoreOS has evolved.

    Per the `CoreOS limitations <https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/booting-with-iso.html#known-limitations>`_,
    as of January 2019, CoreOS:

    1) Current CoreOS images require 2GB of RAM to operate.
    As a result of the RAM requirement, it is problematic for continious
    integration testing to occur with the CoreOS based Ironic-Python-Agent
    image in OpenStack testing infrastructure.

    2) UEFI is not a supported configuration. CoreOS details the required
    use of BIOS compatibility mode. Intel is anticipated to remove
    BIOS compatibility by `2020 <https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/11/intel-to-kill-off-the-last-vestiges-of-the-ancient-pc-bios-by-2020/>`_.

    3) CoreOS is moving to require container use via passing ignition
    configuration. Limitations explicitly state there are no strait-forward
    methods of passing ignition configuration to a CoreOS instance. Mainly the
    developed intent is for such data to be passed in via a metadata service or
    configuration drive.

    4) With the previously mentioned use of containers and ignition
    configuration, the OEM loading path previously used with CoreOS
    is no longer available moving forward as it has been changed to read
    ignition `configuration files <https://github.com/coreos/ignition/pull/475>`_.
