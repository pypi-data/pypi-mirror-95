    Fixes an issue where wholedisk images are requested for deployment and
    the bootloader is overridden. IPA now explicitly looks for the boot
    partition, and examines the contents if the disk appears to be MBR
    bootable. If override/skip bootloader installation does not apply if
    UEFI or PREP boot partitions are present on the disk.
