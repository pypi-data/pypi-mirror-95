    Fixes an issue where the secure erase cleaning step would fail
    if a drive was left in the security-enabled state. This could
    occur if a previous attempt to perform a secure erase had failed
    e.g if there was a power failure mid-way through the cleaning
    process. See `Story 2001762
    <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2001762>`_
    and `Story 2001763
    <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2001763>`_
    for details.
