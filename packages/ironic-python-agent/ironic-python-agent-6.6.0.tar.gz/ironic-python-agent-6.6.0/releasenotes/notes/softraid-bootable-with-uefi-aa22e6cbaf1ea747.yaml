features:

    Adds UEFI boot support for Software RAID, and for partition table
    creation based upon boot mode in use.
upgrade:
  - |
    The type of the partition table created for Software RAID is now based
    upon the boot mode in use (GPT for UEFI or if explicitly passed via the
    instance's capabilities or the node's properties, otherwise MSDOS).
    The amount of reserved space on the drives now also depends on the boot
    mode (128MiB for UEFI/GPT, 8MiB for BIOS/GPT, and one sector otherwise).
