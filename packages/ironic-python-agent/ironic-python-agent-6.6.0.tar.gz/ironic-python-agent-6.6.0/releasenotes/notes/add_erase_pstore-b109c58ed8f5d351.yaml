features:

    Adds a clean step to erase the Linux kernel's pstore. The step is disabled
    by default.
security:
  - |
    If enabled, the new clean step 'erase_pstore' removes all pstore entries
    (the oops/panic logs from a failing kernel) upon cleaning. This is to
    reduce the risk that potentially sensitive data is preserved across
    instantiations (and therefore different users) of a bare metal node.
