    Fixes an issue with the tinyIPA CI testing image by providing a fallback
    root volume uuid detection method via the ``findfs`` utility, which is
    also already packaged in most distributions with ``lsblk``.

    This fallback was necesary as the ``lsblk`` command in ``TinyCore`` Linux,
    upon which TinyIPA is built, does not return data as expected for
    volume UUID values.
