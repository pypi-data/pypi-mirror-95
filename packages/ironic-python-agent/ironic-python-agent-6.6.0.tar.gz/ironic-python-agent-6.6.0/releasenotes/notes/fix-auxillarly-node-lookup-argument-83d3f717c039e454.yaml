    Fixes a minor incorrect keyword argument that was
    matching between the method caller and the unit test but
    not the actual method, unit test, and caller. This was
    a non-fatal issue, and should now permit the agent to
    attempt to lookup the node one last time before deploying
    the instance image to pick-up a root device hint.
