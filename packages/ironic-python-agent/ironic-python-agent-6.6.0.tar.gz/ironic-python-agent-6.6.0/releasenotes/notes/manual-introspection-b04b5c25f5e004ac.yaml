    Adds a new CLI command ``ironic-collect-introspection-data`` to enable
    manually publishing into the ``baremetal-introspection`` service.
    Executing this command on a system unknown to the Bare Metal service
    will likely result in the machine becoming registered to Ironic, and
    as such this command should be used with caution.

    If the capability to update introspection data for running machines
    has been enabled in the Bare Metal introspection service, then an
    operator may use this command in the ``active`` or ``rescue`` states
    to update introspection data.
