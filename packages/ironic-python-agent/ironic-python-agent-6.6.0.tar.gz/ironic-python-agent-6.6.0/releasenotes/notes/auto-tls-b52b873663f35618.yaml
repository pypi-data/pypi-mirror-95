    When a recent enough version of ironic is detected and ``listen_tls`` is
    ``False``, agent will now generate a self-signed TLS certificate and send
    it to ironic on heartbeat. This ensures encrypted communication from
    ironic to the agent. Set ``enable_auto_tls`` to ``False`` to disable this
    behavior.
