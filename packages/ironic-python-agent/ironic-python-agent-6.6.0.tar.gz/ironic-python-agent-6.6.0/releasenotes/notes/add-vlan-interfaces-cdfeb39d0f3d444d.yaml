    Adds the ability to bring up VLAN interfaces and include them in the
    introspection report.  A new kernel params field is added -
    ``ipa-enable-vlan-interfaces``, which defines either the VLAN interface
    to enable, the interface to use, or 'all' - which indicates all
    interfaces.  If the particular VLAN is not provided, IPA will
    use the LLDP information for the interface to determine which VLANs should
    be enabled. See
