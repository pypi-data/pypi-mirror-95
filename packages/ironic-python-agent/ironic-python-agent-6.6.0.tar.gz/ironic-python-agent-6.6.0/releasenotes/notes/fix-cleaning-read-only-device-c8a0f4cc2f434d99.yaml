    Fixes an issue where metadata erasure cleaning would fail on devices
    that are read-only at the hardware level. Typically these are virtual
    devices being offered to the operating system for purposes like OS
    self-installation.

    In the case of full device erasure, this is explicitly raised as
    a hard failure requiring operator intervention.
