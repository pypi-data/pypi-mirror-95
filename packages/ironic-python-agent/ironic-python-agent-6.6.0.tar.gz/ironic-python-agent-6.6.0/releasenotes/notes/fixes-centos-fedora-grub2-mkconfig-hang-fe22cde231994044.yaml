    Fixes an issue where deployments of Fedora or Centos can hang when
    using grub2 with the execution of the ``grub2-mkconfig`` command
    not returning before the deployment process times out. This is
    because ``grub2-mkconfig`` triggers ``os-prober`` which can
    take an extended period of time to evaluate additional unrelated
    devices for dual-boot scenarios. Since operators are not dual
    booting their machines enrolled in ironic, it seems like an
    un-necessary scan and has thus been disabled.
