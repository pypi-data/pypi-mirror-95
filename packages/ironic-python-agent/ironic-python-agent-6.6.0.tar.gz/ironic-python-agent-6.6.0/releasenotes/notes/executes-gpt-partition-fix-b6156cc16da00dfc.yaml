    Fixes an issue where secondary GPT partition tables were not being updated
    after the ``ironic-python-agent`` wrote the disk image to the target disk.
    The agent now unconditionally attempts to repair the secondary partition
    table. Previously, software RAID volumes would report errors upon restart.
