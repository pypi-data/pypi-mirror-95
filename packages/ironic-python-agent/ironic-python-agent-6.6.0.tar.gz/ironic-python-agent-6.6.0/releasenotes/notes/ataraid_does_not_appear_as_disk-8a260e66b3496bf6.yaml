    Fixes an issue where devices offered via ATARAID
    (or even software RAID setup by a hardware manager)
    were excluded from the list as they are not returned
    as type disk, even though they should be considered
    both disks and block devices.
    See `story <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2003445>`_
    for more details.

    Operators with custom hardware managers to support software RAID
    may wish to ensure that they have removed the software RAID prior
    to any stock cleaning step for erasing block devices executes.
    As a result of a bug fix, such devices may now be picked up in
    the list of possible devices to delete, which may extend cleaning
    depending on the deployment configuration.
