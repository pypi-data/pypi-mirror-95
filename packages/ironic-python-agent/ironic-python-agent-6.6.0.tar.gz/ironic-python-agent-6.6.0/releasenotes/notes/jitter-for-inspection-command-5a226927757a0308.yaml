    Fixes risk of potential active node thundering heard by introducing
    jitter handling into the ``ironic-collect-introspection-data``.
    By default, the jitter will cause the
    ``introspection_daemon_post_interval`` configuration parameter based
    time value to be honored between in a range of 70% to 120% of the
    desired time window.

    Should failures occur after the initial connection and start of the
    daemon mode for introspection data collection, the fallback is a maximum
    of 400% of the introspection daemon post interval.
