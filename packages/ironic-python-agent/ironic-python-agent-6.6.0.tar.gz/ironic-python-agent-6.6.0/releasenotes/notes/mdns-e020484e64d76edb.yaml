features:
  - |
    Supports fetching baremetal and baremetal introspection endpoints from
    mDNS instead of providing them via kernel parameters or a configuration
    file. See `story 2005393
    <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2005393>`_ for more details.
upgrade:
  - |
    When no baremetal API URL is provided (e.g. via the ``ipa-api-url`` kernel
    parameter), ironic-python-agent now tries to get the URL using mDNS service
    discovery.
