        Overview
        ========
        
        An agent for controlling and deploying Ironic controlled baremetal nodes.
        
        The ironic-python-agent works with the agent driver in Ironic to provision
        the node.  Starting with ironic-python-agent running on a ramdisk on the
        unprovisioned node, Ironic makes API calls to ironic-python-agent to provision
        the machine.  This allows for greater control and flexibility of the entire
        deployment process.
        
        The ironic-python-agent may also be used with the original Ironic pxe drivers
        as of the Kilo OpenStack release.
        
        
        Building the IPA deployment ramdisk
        ===================================
        
        For more information see the `Image Builder <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic-python-agent/latest/install/index.html#image-builders>`_ section of the Ironic Python Agent
        developer guide.
        
        
        Using IPA with devstack
        =======================
        
        This is covered in the `Deploying Ironic with DevStack <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/contributor/dev-quickstart.html#deploying-ironic-with-devstack>`_
        section of the Ironic dev-quickstart guide.
