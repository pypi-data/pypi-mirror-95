## Optional `python-lzo`
If `python-lzo` is not present, you' ll see "LZO compression support is not available" when running `readmdict`. Should this bother you, install `python-lzo`.

```bash
pip install python-lzo
# or poerty add python-lzo
```

In Windows without a functioning C++ environment, you won't be able to install `python-lzo` via `pip`. Head to
[https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#python-lzo](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#python-lzo). Download and install `python-lzo` whl for your python version.
