Description: # pytryfi - Python Interface for TryFi
        This python interface enables you to gather information about your dogs whereabouts, your user details and any bases you may have.
        
        NOTE: Since this interacts with undocumented APIs, this may change without notice.
        
        ## Installation
        TBD
        
        ## Usage
        TryFi uses Graphql for its APIs. Essentially, you will use your username (email address) and password to retrieve a unique username specific for API calls which in turn will be used for the duration to retrieve data.
        
        ### Example
        ```python
        #this will create the object and gather all the necessary data
        tryfi = PyTryFi(username, password)
        print(tryfi)
        
        #this will perform a complete refresh of all Pets and data points
        tryfi.updatePets()
        
        #this will perform a complete refresh of all Bases and data points
        tryfi.updateBases()
        
        #this will perform an update on both Pets and Bases and their associated data points
        tryfi.update()
        
        #this will update the last reported location of a bet
        tryfi.pets[0].updatePetLocation(tryfi.session)
        
        #this will update the stats of the pet 
        tryfi.pets[0].updateStats(tryfi.session)
        
        #update the device/collar details for the given pet
        tryfi.pets[0].updateDeviceDetails(tryfi.session)
        
        #update the all details for a given pet
        tryfi.pets[0].updateAllDetails(tryfi.session)
        
        #this will set the light color of the collar
        tryfi.pets[0].setLedColorCode(tryfi.session, 2)
        
        #this will turn on the LED light on the color
        tryfi.pets[0].turnOnOffLed(tryfi.session,True)
        #or turn it off
        tryfi.pets[0].turnOnOffLed(tryfi.session,False)
        
        #this will turn on the lost dog mode
        tryfi.pets[0].setLostDogMode(tryfi.session,True)
        #or turn it off
        tryfi.pets[0].setLostDogMode(tryfi.session,False)
        
        #this will get the lost dog mode status/state currently in the object
        tryfi.pets[0].isLost
        ```
        
        ## To Do
        * Provide Activity Data History
        
        ## Links:
        * [TryFi](https://tryfi.com/)
        
        # Version History
        ## 0.0.9
        * Bugfix - get LED status based on additional logic that compares the ledOffAt date with the current date/time. Update the boolean to True or False base on the additional date comparison.
        
        ## 0.0.8
        * Bugfix - handle unknown location
        
        ## 0.0.7
        * Bug fixes when updating objects
        
        ## 0.0.6
        * Added function to submit Lost Dog Action
        * Added isLost property to Pet
        * Code cleanup
        
        ## 0.0.5
        * Added global update function that updates both pets and bases (pytryfi.update())
        * Added better error handling
        
        ## 0.0.4
        * created update functions for various pet and device objects and a global update for the pet
        * added last updated date/time to the objects to track when the data was last updated
        * changed turn on/off action to boolean
        * when performing an action on the collar, update the data that is retrieved at the same time
        
        ## 0.0.3
        The following updates/enhancements were made:
        * moved updated pet location from base object to pet class
        * created function to update the stats of the pet
        * converted approriate variables to integers, floats and dates
        * created function to set the LED color on the collar
        * created function to turn on/off LED on a collar
