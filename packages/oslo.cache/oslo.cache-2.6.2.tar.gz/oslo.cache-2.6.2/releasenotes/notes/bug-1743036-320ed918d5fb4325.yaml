    [`bug 1743036 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/oslo.cache+bug/1743036>`_]
    The `backend_argument` value(s) for `url` when configuring memcache did not
    properly handle multiple servers. This is because the URL was passed as
    a string (comma delimited) instead of a list to the memcache
    library/client. The `url` argument is now special cased and will split
    the string on a comma so that it mirrors the behavior of the ListOpt used
    by `memcache_servers` option.
