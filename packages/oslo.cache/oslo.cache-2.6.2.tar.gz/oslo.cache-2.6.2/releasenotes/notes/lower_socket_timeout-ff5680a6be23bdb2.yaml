    The default value for ``memcache_socket_timeout`` has been lowered from 3
    seconds to 1 second. The positive side-effect of this can be found in
    downstream `changes
    <https://github.com/crowbar/crowbar-openstack/pull/1429>`_. If you
    deployment relies explicitly on a timeout of 3 seconds, please set that
    override in your configuration.
