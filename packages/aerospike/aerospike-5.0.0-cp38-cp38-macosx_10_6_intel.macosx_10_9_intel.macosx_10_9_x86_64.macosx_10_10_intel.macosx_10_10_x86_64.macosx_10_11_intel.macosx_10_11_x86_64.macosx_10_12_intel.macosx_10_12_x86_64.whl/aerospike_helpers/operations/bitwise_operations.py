Helper functions to create bit operation dictionary arguments for
the :mod:`aerospike.Client.operate` and :mod:`aerospike.Client.operate_ordered` methods of the aerospike client.

    .. note:: Bitwise operations require server version >= 4.6.0

Bit offsets are oriented left to right. Negative offsets are supported and start backwards from the end of the target bitmap.

Offset examples:
    * 0: leftmost bit in the map
    * 4: fifth bit in the map
    * -1: rightmost bit in the map
    * -4: 3 bits from rightmost
