Helper functions to create HyperLogLog operation dictionary arguments for
the :mod:`aerospike.Client.operate` and :mod:`aerospike.Client.operate_ordered` methods of the aerospike client.
HyperLogLog bins and operations allow for your application to form fast, reasonable approximations
of members in the union or intersection between multiple HyperLogLog bins.
HyperLogLogâ€™s estimates are a balance between complete accuracy and efficient savings
in space and speed in dealing with extremely large datasets.

    .. note:: HyperLogLog operations require server version >= 4.9.0

    .. seealso:: `HyperLogLog (Data Type) more info. <https://www.aerospike.com/docs/guide/hyperloglog.html>`_.
