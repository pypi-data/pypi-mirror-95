"""This pre-processing optimization method was abandoned in favor of that implememented, but was largely complete
at the time that was decided, so here is the code in case it is useful to anybody
# for each district pair and each school level, narrow the list of candidates for min commute based on following:
# find the minimum distances (as many as the desired number of minimums), take the largest of these
# the maximum estimate for the commute time for this distance is: (circuituity_factor/slow_commute_speed)*distance
# considering that the minimum estimated commute for any distance is: distance/fast_commute_speed
# it is not worth considering distances where their minimum estimated commute is
# longer than the maximum estimated commute thus, we wish to exclude distances longer than:
# largest_min_dist*fast_commute_speed*(circuituity_factor/slow_commute_speed) from the accurate commute analysis

# ADDITIONAL INPUT PARAMETERS NEEDED
# circuituity_factor = 2
# slow_commute_speed = 30
# fast_commute_speed = 60
# number_of_minimums_per_disct_pair = 3

# create a table to store the pairs for which to gather actual commute estimates from API
