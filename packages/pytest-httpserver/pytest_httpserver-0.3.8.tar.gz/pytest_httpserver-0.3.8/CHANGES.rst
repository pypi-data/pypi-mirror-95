0.3.7
=====

.. _Release Notes_0.3.7_Other Notes:

Other Notes
-----------

- Removed pytest-runner from setup.py as it is deprecated and makes packaging inconvenient

.. _Release Notes_0.3.6:

0.3.6
=====

.. _Release Notes_0.3.6_New Features:

New Features
------------

- HTTP methods are case insensitive. The HTTP method specified is converted to
  uppercase in the library.

- It is now possible to specify a JSON-serializable python value (such as
  dict, list, etc) and match the request to it as JSON. The request's body
  is loaded as JSON and it will be compared to the expected value.

- The http response code sent when no handler is found for the
  request can be changed. It is set to 500 by default.


.. _Release Notes_0.3.5:

0.3.5
=====

.. _Release Notes_0.3.5_New Features:

New Features
------------

- Extend URI matching by allowing to specify URIPattern object or a compiled
  regular expression, which will be matched against the URI. URIPattern class
  is defined as abstract in the library so the user need to implement a new
  class based on it.


.. _Release Notes_0.3.4:

0.3.4
=====

.. _Release Notes_0.3.4_Bug Fixes:

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix the tests assets created for SSL/TLS tests by extending their expiration time. Also
  update the Makefile which can be used to update these assets.


.. _Release Notes_0.3.3:

0.3.3
=====

.. _Release Notes_0.3.3_New Features:

New Features
------------

- Besides bytes and string, dict and MultiDict objects can be specified as query_string.
  When these objects are used, the query string gets parsed into a dict (or MultiDict),
  and comparison is made accordingly. This enables the developer to ignore the order of
  the keys in the query_string when expecting a request.


.. _Release Notes_0.3.3_Bug Fixes:

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed issue \#16 by converting string object passed as query_string
  to bytes which is the type of the query string in werkzeug, and also allowing
  bytes as the parameter.

- Fix release tagging. 0.3.2 was released in a mistake by tagging 3.0.2 to the branch.


.. _Release Notes_0.3.3_Other Notes:

Other Notes
-----------

- Add more files to source distribution (sdist). It now contains tests,
  assets, examples and other files.


.. _Release Notes_0.3.1:

0.3.1
=====

.. _Release Notes_0.3.1_New Features:

New Features
------------

- Add httpserver_listen_address fixture which is used to set up the bind address and port
  of the server. Setting bind address and port is possible by overriding this fixture.


.. _Release Notes_0.3.0:

0.3.0
=====

.. _Release Notes_0.3.0_New Features:

New Features
------------

- Support ephemeral port. This can be used by specify 0 as the port number
  to the HTTPServer instance. In such case, an unused port will be picked up
  and the server will start listening on that port. Querying the port attribute
  after server start reveals the real port where the server is actually listening.

- Unify request functions of the HTTPServer class to make the API more straightforward to use.


.. _Release Notes_0.3.0_Upgrade Notes:

Upgrade Notes
-------------

- The default port has been changed to 0, which results that the server will be staring
  on an ephemeral port.

- The following methods of HTTPServer have been changed in a backward-incompatible way:
    * :py:meth:`pytest_httpserver.HTTPServer.expect_request` becomes a general function accepting handler_type parameter so it can create any kind of request handlers
    * :py:meth:`pytest_httpserver.HTTPServer.expect_oneshot_request` no longer accepts the ordered parameter, and it creates an unordered oneshot request handler
    * :py:meth:`pytest_httpserver.HTTPServer.expect_ordered_request` is a new method craeting an ordered request handler


.. _Release Notes_0.2.2:

0.2.2
