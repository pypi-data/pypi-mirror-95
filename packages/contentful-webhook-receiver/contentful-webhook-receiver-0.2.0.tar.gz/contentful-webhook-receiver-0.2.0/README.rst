Documentation

The full documentation is at https://contentful-webhook-receiver.readthedocs.io.

Quickstart
----------

Install Contentful Webhook Receiver::

    pip install contentful-webhook-receiver

Add it to your `INSTALLED_APPS`:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'contentful_webhook_receiver.apps.ContentfulWebhookReceiverConfig',
        ...
    )

Add Contentful Webhook Receiver's URL patterns:

.. code-block:: python

    from contentful_webhook_receiver import urls as contentful_webhook_receiver_urls


    urlpatterns = [
        ...
        url(r'^', include(contentful_webhook_receiver_urls)),
        ...
    ]


Listen for the Contentful Webhook Receiver signal:

.. code-block:: python

    @receiver(contentful_publish_entry)
    def entry_published(sender, instance: WebhookInvocation, **kwargs):
        print(instance.data['sys']['content_type']['id'])

Register a Webhook on Contentful:

The path added to the urlpatterns is `^contentful-webhook/$`.
If you're adding it to the root url configuration the path will be `https://example.com/contentful-webook/`
