    """
    Janitor provides a uniform way to deal with the possibility of exceptions
    in a function that acquires more and more temporary resources as it
    proceeds. While it's possible to structure such a function as:

    first = acquire()
    try:
        # ...
        second = acquire()
        try:
            # ...
            third = acquire()
            try:
                # ...
            finally:
                third.release()
        finally:
            second.release()
    finally:
        first.release()

    the extra indentation obscures the business logic, and (given finite
    screen width) makes it harder to read later code passages.

    Janitor 'flattens' the logic:

    with Janitor() as janitor:
        first = acquire()
        janitor.cleanup(first.release)
        # ...
        second = acquire()
        janitor.cleanup(second.release)
        # ...
        third = acquire()
        janitor.cleanup(third.release)
        # ...

    An exception that occurs anywhere in the body of the 'with' block will
    cause that Janitor instance to clean up exactly the resources that have
    been acquired to that point. On successful completion of the 'with' block,
    all temporary resources are cleaned up.

    Resources are cleaned up in reverse order of acquisition, just as in the
    try/finally nesting illustrated above.

    Moreover, Janitor also supports atomicity. A function that must produce
    multiple side effects if successful -- or none at all on failure -- can
    use Janitor as follows:

    with Janitor() as janitor:
        first = create()
        janitor.rollback(first.destroy)
        # ...
        second = create()
        janitor.rollback(second.destroy)
        # ...

    If the second create() (or anything after janitor.rollback(first.destroy))
    raises an exception, first.destroy() is called, and so forth.

    cleanup() and rollback() calls may be intermingled. An action passed to
    cleanup() is performed unconditionally; an action passed to rollback() is
    performed only on exception. The appropriate actions are still performed
    in strict reverse order:

    with Janitor() as janitor:
        janitor.cleanup(print, 'first')
        janitor.rollback(print, 'second')
        janitor.cleanup(print, 'third')
        raise RuntimeError('stop')

    prints:

    third
    second
    first

    Without the exception:

    with Janitor() as janitor:
        janitor.cleanup(print, 'first')
        janitor.rollback(print, 'second')
        janitor.cleanup(print, 'third')

    prints:

    third
    first

    Usage:

    Context Manager:
    with Janitor(sys.stdout) as janitor: # report cleanup actions on stdout
        ...
        janitor.cleanup(shutil.rmtree, some_temp_directory)
        ...
        janitor.rollback(os.remove, candidatefile)
        ...
    # exiting 'with' block normally performs cleanup() actions;
    # exiting with an exception performs cleanup() and rollback() actions

    Passing a file-like output stream to Janitor's constructor causes it to
    report its actions to that stream.

    Passing a _desc='description string' keyword parameter to either cleanup()
    or rollback() causes Janitor to report the operation in question using
    that 'description string'. Otherwise it attempts to deduce the function
    name. The underscore on _desc is to permit passing a desc= keyword
    parameter to a cleanup action.

    A Janitor instance is reusable. Thus it may be stored as an instance
    attribute of a class object and shared among methods of that class; the
    top-level entry point can write 'with self.janitor:' and control the final
    cleanup.

    Moreover, the same Janitor instance (e.g. an instance attribute) may be
    reused in nested 'with' statements (e.g. in that object's methods).
    Exiting each 'with' block only performs cleanup actions (whether cleanup()
    or rollback()) registered within or below that 'with' block, according to
    how that particular 'with' block is exited.

    Test Class:
    class TestMySoftware(unittest.TestCase, Janitor):
        def __init__(self):
            Janitor.__init__(self)  # quiet cleanup
            ...

        def setUp(self):
            ...
            self.cleanup(os.rename, saved_file, original_location)
            ...

        def tearDown(self):
            Janitor.tearDown(self)  # calls done()
            ...
            # Or, if you have no other tearDown() logic for
            # TestMySoftware, you can omit the TestMySoftware.tearDown()
            # def entirely and let it inherit Janitor.tearDown().

    Note that outside a 'with' block, Janitor cannot distinguish between
    successful completion and exception -- so in that case it does not honor
    rollback(). In fact, calling rollback() on a Janitor instance not used as
    a context manager raises Error. This is deemed safer than silently
    ignoring rollback() calls.
