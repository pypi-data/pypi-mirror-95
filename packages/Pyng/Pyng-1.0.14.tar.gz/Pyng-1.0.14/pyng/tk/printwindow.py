This module defines a class that you can use to open a temporary output window
into which to dump transient progress output, such as the voluminous output
from a C++ compilation. It doesn't deal with user input AT ALL; it merely
opens a scrolling Tkinter window. Because it's a "file-like object," you can
write() to it and even assign it to sys.stdout if you're so minded, which
means it will display all your 'print' output.
