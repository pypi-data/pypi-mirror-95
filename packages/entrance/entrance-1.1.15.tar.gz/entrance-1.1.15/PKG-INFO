Description: # EnTrance
        
        [EnTrance](https://github.com/ensoft/entrance) is a framework for writing
        simple but robust web apps, with a particular set of characteristics. It uses a
        Python 3.5+ asyncio backend, and an Elm frontend, communicating over a
        websocket.
        
        This package provides the server-side functionality.
        
        Reading the documentation and sample applications in [the primary
        repo](https://github.com/ensoft/entrance) is recommended. Simple examples for
        writing your own Python server-side feature are in [sample
        2](https://github.com/ensoft/entrance/blob/master/samples/2_shell/svr/run.py)
        and [sample
        3](https://github.com/ensoft/entrance/blob/master/samples/3_browser/svr/run.py).
        
        By default, the dependencies for this package cover the core functionality.
        There is also a rich set of optional capability for interacting with routers,
        that has a much more extended set of PyPi dependencies. If you want to use
        this, then depend on `entrance[with-router-features]` rather than just `entrance`.
