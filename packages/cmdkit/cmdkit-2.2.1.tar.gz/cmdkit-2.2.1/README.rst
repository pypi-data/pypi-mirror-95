The *cmdkit* library implements a few common patterns needed by well-formed command-line
applications in Python. It only touches a few concepts but it implements them well.
The idea is to reduce the boilerplate needed to get a full featured CLI off the ground.
Applications developed using *cmdkit* are easy to implement, easy to maintain, and easy to
understand.

Features
--------

- An `Interface <https://cmdkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/cli.html#cmdkit.cli.Interface>`_
  class for parsing command-line arguments.
- An `Application <https://cmdkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/app.html#cmdkit.app.Application>`_
  class that provides the boilerplate for a good entry-point.
- A `Configuration <https://cmdkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/config.html#cmdkit.config.Configuration>`_
  class built on top of a recursive
  `Namespace <https://cmdkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/config.html#cmdkit.config.Namespace>`_
  class that provides automatic depth-first merging of dictionaries from local files,
  as well as automatic environment variable discovery and type-coercion.
