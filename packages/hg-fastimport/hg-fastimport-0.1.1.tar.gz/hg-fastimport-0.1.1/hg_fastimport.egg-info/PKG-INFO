Description: =============
        hg-fastimport
        =============
        
        WARNING: this extension is incomplete and lightly tested.  It is
        currently intended for Mercurial developers or particularly daring
        users.
        
        hg-fastimport is a Mercurial extension for importing Git's fast-import
        dumps into Mercurial. fast-import is a file format for representing the
        entire history of a version control repository.
        
        This file format was designed to make it easier to write tools which
        convert from foreign (non-Git) VCS repository formats into Git; such
        tools exist for CVS, Mercurial, Darcs, and Perforce.
