""".. versionadded:: 0.3.21

When a client connects to the server, it is useful to know who they claim to
be. One such method is looking up the PTR records for the client's IP address
in DNS. If it exists, a PTR record will map an IP address to an arbitrary
hostname.

However, it is not usually desired to slow down a client's request just because
their PTR record lookup has not yet finished. This module implements a
:class:`~gevent.Greenlet` thread that will look up a client's PTR record will
its request is being processed. If the request finishes before the PTR record
lookup, the lookup is stopped.
