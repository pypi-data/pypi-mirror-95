    :param num_episodes_per_improvement: Number of policy evaluation episodes to execute for each iteration of policy
    improvement.
    :param num_updates_per_improvement: Number of state-action value updates to execute for each iteration of policy
    improvement, or None for policy improvement per specified number of episodes.
    :param alpha: Constant step size to use when updating Q-values, or None for 1/n step size.
    :param mode: Evaluation mode (see `rlai.gpi.temporal_difference.evaluation.Mode`).
    :param n_steps: Number of steps (see `rlai.gpi.temporal_difference.evaluation.evaluate_q_pi`).
    :param planning_environment: Planning environment to learn and use.
    :param make_final_policy_greedy: Whether or not to make the agent's final policy greedy with respect to the q-values
    that have been learned, regardless of the value of epsilon used to estimate the q-values.
    :param q_S_A: State-action value estimator.
    :param thread_manager: Thread manager. The current function (and the thread running it) will wait on this manager
    before starting each iteration. This provides a mechanism for pausing, resuming, and aborting training. Omit for no
    waiting.
    :param num_improvements_per_plot: Number of improvements to make before plotting the per-improvement average. Pass
    None to turn off all plotting.

    :param checkpoint_path: Checkpoint path. Must be provided if `num_improvements_per_checkpoint` is provided.
