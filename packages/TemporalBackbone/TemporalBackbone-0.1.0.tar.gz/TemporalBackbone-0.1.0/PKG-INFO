Description: # A tool to detect the backbone in temporal networks
        
        An efficient and fast tool to detect the backbone network in temporal networks. For accurate results, it should be applied to networks with at least 1,000 nodes.
        
        The computational time is O(N_E T^2), where N_E are the number unique edges in the network and T the number of time steps. 
        
        For sparse networks (like most of the large networks), the computational time is O(N T^2)
        
        
        How to install it 
        
        ```
        pip install TemporalBackbone
        ```
        
        How to run the package
        
        ```
        import TemporalBackbone as TB
        
        data = TB.Read_sample()
        TB.Temporal_Backbone(data)
        ```
        
            
        Input: 
        - pandas dataframe with three columns: ***node1, node2, time*** *(order is important)*
        - Minimum length of the interval: ***default 1 day** (time step is taken from the data)*
        - whether the network is directed or not: ***default True***
        - whether to use the Bonferroni correction: ***default True***
        - threshold to determine the significance of a link: ***default 0.01***
            
        Output:
        - list with the significant links

        The methodology is first introduced in

        Then was deemed as appropriate for large temporal networks, having a good trade-off between false positives and false negatives. See
