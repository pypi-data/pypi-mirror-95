Description: TensorFlow Lattice is a library that implements fast-to-evaluate and
        interpretable (optionally monotonic) lattice based models, which are also known
        as *interpolated look-up tables*. The library includes a collection of
        Estimators, which operate like any TensorFlow Estimator. It also includes
        Keras layers for lattices and feature calibration that can be composed
        into custom models.
