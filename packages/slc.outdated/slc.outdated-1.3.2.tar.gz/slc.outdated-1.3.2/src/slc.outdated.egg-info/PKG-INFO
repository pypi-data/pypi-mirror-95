        slc.outdated
        ============
        
        slc.outdated provides an object action for plone to toggle an
        *outdated* flag on any object that is IAnnotatable. The value of the
        flag is stored in an annotation, indexed in the catalog via an indexer
        and included in the metadata.
        
        By that you can use it for catalog queries and e.g. set CSS classes
        accordingly.
        
        A viewlet will appear below the title of outdated content, indicating
        that this content is outdated. Further, the acquisition chain will be
        consulted for "outdated_info" and if found, its title and text body
        will be displayed. It should be published and hidden from the
        navigation.
        
        The software is tested manually and fully functional. The lack of
        tests I consider a bug. I'd be most grateful if you donate tests, in
        case you plan on using slc.outdated.
