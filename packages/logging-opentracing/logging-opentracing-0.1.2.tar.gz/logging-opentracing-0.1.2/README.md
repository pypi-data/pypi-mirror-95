# opentracing-logging-python
OpenTracing handler for the Python logging library

**Information: This library is currently in a beta state**

## Installation

Install the package with pip

```
pip install logging-opentracing
```

## Usage
We use the mock tracer for the follwing examples but you can also use other OpenTracing compatible tracers.

An compatible tracer would be, for instance, [Jaeger](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-python)

### Simple
In the first example we initialize the `OpenTracingHandler` for `logging` and create an active span with the name
`hello-world`.
In this active span we make make an info-log and in the end we have a look if this log was forwarded to OpenTracing.

```python
import logging

from opentracing.mocktracer import MockTracer

from logging_opentracing import OpenTracingHandler

# initialize a mock tracer
tracer = MockTracer()

# prepare the logger
logger = logging.getLogger('mylogger')
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

# create a new OpenTracing handler for the logging package
handler = OpenTracingHandler(tracer=tracer)
logger.addHandler(handler)

# start an active span
with tracer.start_active_span('hello-world'):
    # this log will be propagated to
    logger.info('Hello World from Python logging to OpenTracing')

# retrieve the finished span
finished_span = tracer.finished_spans()[0]
# get the log line from
log = finished_span.logs[0]

# print the key_values of the log
print(log.key_values)
# {'event': 'info', 'message': 'Hello World from Python logging to OpenTracing'}
```

Here some additional explanation

```python
# initialize a mock tracer
tracer = MockTracer()
```
Initialize the mock tracer from the OpenTracing library.
As mentioned before, instead you can use any OpenTracing compatible tracer.

```python
# prepare the logger
logger = logging.getLogger('mylogger')
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
```
Prepare a logger from the Python `logging` package.
Set its logging level to `INFO` such that logs with the severity `INFO` are also captured.

```python
# create a new OpenTracing handler for the logging package
handler = OpenTracingHandler(tracer=tracer)
logger.addHandler(handler)
```
First, initialize the OpenTracing handler `OpenTracingHandler` for `logging`.
It needs an OpenTracing tracer as parameter.
Then, add the handler to the logger.

```python
# start an active span
with tracer.start_active_span('hello-world'):
    # this log will be propagated to
    logger.info('Hello World from Python logging to OpenTracing')
```
Start a new active span with the name `hello-world`.
Within this active span, make a log with the severity info.
It is expected that this log will be captured by our handler for OpenTracing which should forward the log to our tracer.

```python
# retrieve the finished span
finished_span = tracer.finished_spans()[0]
# get the log line from
log = finished_span.logs[0]

# print the key_values of the log
print(log.key_values)
# {'event': 'info', 'message': 'Hello World from Python logging to OpenTracing'}
```
These lines are only used to check if the log has been successfully forwarder to out tracer.

### Custom Formatter
The previous example showed how logs are forwarded to OpenTracing with the default formating option for logs.
Thereby, the defalt format is `{'info': <log severity>, 'message': <log format>}`.

In the case that a different formatting is required, in the constructor of `OpenTracingHandler` can be adjusted.
To do so, set the parameter `kv_format`.
It expects a dictionary, where each key-value pair represents a key value pair forwarded to the method `log_kv()` of
OpenTracing. Thereby,

- `key` is the key which will be directly used as key in the OpenTracing log
- `value` is a string which can contain placeholders for %-stype formatting of the logging package. (See also [Format](#format) for more details)

For each key-value pair a new formatter `logging.Formatter` will be created.

When we replace from the previous [simple example](#Simple) the lines
```python
# create a new OpenTracing handler for the logging package
handler = OpenTracingHandler(tracer=tracer)
```
with the following lines
```python
# create a new formatter with a custom format
formatter = OpenTracingFormatter(kv_format={
    'event': '%(levelname_lower)s',
    'message': '%(message)s',
    'source': '%(filename)s:L%(lineno)d',
})

# create a new OpenTracing handler which uses the custom formatter
handler = OpenTracingHandler(tracer=tracer, formatter=formatter)
```
we initialize a handler with a formatter with a custom format.

The expected output of the modified example is
```
{'event': 'info', 'message': 'Hello World from Python logging to OpenTracing', 'source': 'custom_formatter.py:L26'}
```

See the full example [custom_formatter.py](examples/custom_formatter.py)

### Manually pass a span
The OpenTracing logging handler tries to retrieve a span by accessing the current scope
`scope = tracer.scope_manager.active` and an the case that a scope is available accessing its current span
`span = scope.span`.
However, such a scope is only available when a scope has been indirectly created through starting an active span
`tracer.start_active_span()` or when a scope has been directly activated `tracer.scope_manager.activate()`.

Therefore it is also possible to pass a span to a log with the `extra` parameter.
```python
# start a span
with tracer.start_span('hello-world') as span:
    # the span is directly passed to the log with the "extra" parameter
    logger.info('A span has been directly passed', extra={'span': span})
```

The default key which is used to check if a span has been passed is `'span'`.
However, it can be customized in the instantiation of the handler.
```python
handler = OpenTracingHandler(tracer=tracer, span_key='sp')

# ...

# start a span
with tracer.start_span('hello-world') as span:
    # the span is directly passed to the log with the "extra" parameter
    # this time we have to use the key "sp" because we set span_key='sp' in the constructor
    logger.info('A span has been directly passed', extra={'sp': span})
```

See the full example [span_passed.py](examples/span_passed.py)

### Exception
The OpenTracing handler can also be used to log exceptions.
To do so, just log with the the level `exception`.

```python
try:
    logger.info('This will be difficult')
    # this statement will cause a ZeroDivisionError
    1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    logger.exception('Oh no we have a ZeroDivision Error')
```

This would result in the logs
```
{'event': 'info', 'message': 'This will be difficult'}
{'event': 'error', 'message': 'Oh no we have a ZeroDivision Error', 'error.object': ZeroDivisionError('division by zero'), 'error.kind': <class 'ZeroDivisionError'>, 'stack': '  File \"<path_suffix>/logging_opentracing/examples/exception.py\" line 23, in <module>\\n    1 / 0\\n'}
```
where the same formatting is used like OpenTracing uses when an uncaught exception is created.

See the full example [exception.py](examples/exception.py)

### Additional key-value pairs
To each logging call extra key-value pairs can be passed which should be included in a OpenTracing log.
Pass a dictionary with the key-value pairs to be added to the key `kv` of the extra parameter of a logging call.

```python
# add additional key-value pairs to the log by providing a dict to the key "kv" of the "extra" parameter
logger.info('Here we pass additional arguments to the log', extra={'kv': {'key a': [1, 2, 3], 'key b': 'foo'}})
```
which results in a log
```
{'event': 'info', 'message': 'Here we pass additional arguments to the log', 'key a': [1, 2, 3], 'key b': 'foo'}
```

Per default these additional key-value pairs are expected to have the key `kv`.
However, this can be customized by setting the parameter `extra_kv_key` of the constructor of `OpenTracingHandler`.

```python
OpenTracingHandler(tracer=tracer, extra_kv_key='properties')

# ...

# add additional key-value pairs to the log by providing a dict to the customized key "properties" of the "extra" parameter
logger.info('Here we pass additional arguments to the log', extra={'properties': {'key a': [1, 2, 3], 'key b': 'foo'}})
```

See the full example [extra_kv.py](examples/extra_kv.py)

## Format
This library uses `logging.Formatter(fmt=fmt).format(logging_LogRecord)` for getting information from a
`logging.LogRecord`, where `fmt` is the format specified in the
values of the parameter `kv_format` in the constructor of `OpenTracingHandler`.
`logging_LogRecord` is the variable which hold a `logging.logRecord`.

Therefore, the format of `fmt` follows the formatting specification of
[LogRecord attributes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logrecord-attributes).

Following, an excerpt of the official Python docs; use the format placeholders specified in the column `Format`.

| Attribute name | Format | Description |
|----------------|--------|-------------|
| asctime | `%(asctime)s` | Human-readable time when the LogRecord was created. By default this is of the form ‘2003-07-08 16:49:45,896’ (the numbers after the comma are millisecond portion of the time). |
| created | `%(created)f` | Time when the LogRecord was created (as returned by time.time()). |
| filename | `%(filename)s` | Filename portion of `pathname`. |
| funcName | `%(funcName)s` | Name of function containing the logging call. |
| levelname | `%(levelname)s` | Text logging level for the message (`'DEBUG'`, `'INFO'`, `'WARNING'`, `'ERROR'`, `'CRITICAL'`). |
| levelname_lower | `%(levelname_lower)s` | Lower case text logging level for the message (`'debug'`, `'info'`, `'warning'`, `'error'`, `'critical'`). This is a non-default attribute which will be automatically added by the OpenTracingFormatter. |
| levelno | `%(levelno)s` | Numeric logging level for the message (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL). |
| lineno | `%(lineno)d` | Source line number where the logging call was issued (if available). |
