Description: # PyMonitorLib
        Lightweight python library for collecting metrics and outputing to influx DB on an interval.
        
        This library is designed for creating interval based monitoring applications quickly and easily. a Main function initializes the application and a Process function is called at the regular interval.
        
        An example for all that is required:
        
        ```python
        from monitor.lib import Execute, Result
        
        def Main(config, logger, pipeline):
            return Result.SUCCESS
        
        if __name__ == "__main__":
             Execute(Main, 'service')
        ```
        
        The example will create an ArgumentParser for the necessary argument collect and spin up a process.
        
        ## Notes
        This library currently only supports linux/posix based systems for use in process daemonization. Windows services are not currently supported. Basic functionality for building OS independent monitors should still function.
