Description: # Misty2py
        Misty2py is a python wrapper around [Misty API](https://docs.mistyrobotics.com/misty-ii/rest-api/api-reference/ "Misty Robotics REST API").
        
        ## Features
        Misty2py can be used to:
        - **perform actions** as an equivalent to sending a POST request to Misty's API;
        - **obtain information** as an equivalent to sending a GET request to Misty's API.
        
        This can be done comfortably from Python by employing following concepts:
        - **action keywords** - Python-styled keywords for endpoints of Misty's API that correspond to performing actions;
        - **information keywords** - Python-styled keywords for endpoints of Misty's API that correspond to retrieving information;
        - **data shortcuts** - Python-styled keywords for commonly used data that is supplied to Misty's API as the body of a POST request.
        
        ## Usage
        - start by making a new instance of `Misty`:
        ```
        from misty2py.robot import Misty
        misty_robot = Misty("0.0.0.0")
        ```
        - substitute `"0.0.0.0"` by the IP address of your Misty.
        - use method `perform_action` to tell Misty to perform an action
            - currently you can only use `misty_robot.perform_action('led', dct=colours, method="dict")` to change the LED light on Misty's chest to a supplied json value or `misty_robot.perform_action('led', string="led_off", method="string")` to turn the LED light on Misty's chest off
            - the action `led` corresponds to the `/api/led` endpoint
        - use method `get_info` to tell Misty to return information
            - currently only `misty_robot.get_info(blink_settings)` to obtain blink settings is supported (corresponds to the `api/blink/settings` endpoint)
            
        ### More action and information keywords and data shortcuts will be added soon
