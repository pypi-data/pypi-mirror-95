# tednet
``tednet`` is a toolkit for tensor decomposition networks. Tensor decomposition networks are neural networks whose layers are decomposed by tensor decomposition, including CANDECOMP/PARAFAC, Tucker2, Tensor Train, Tensor Ring and so on. For a convenience to do research on it, ``tednet`` provides excellent tools to deal with tensorial networks.


Now, **tednet** is easy to be installed by `pip`:

```shell script
pip install tednet
```
