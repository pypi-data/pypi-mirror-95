    """
    *(Abstract class)* Iterator that yields a word at each step and read the corresponding vector
    only if the lazy property ``current_vector`` is accessed.

    **Iteration model.** The iteration model is not the most obvious: each iteration step doesn't
    return a word vector pair. Instead, for performance reasons, at each step a reader returns
    the next word. To read the vector for the current word, you must access the (lazy) property
    :meth:`current_vector`::

        with emb_file.reader() as reader:
            for word in reader:
                if word in my_vocab:
                    word2vec[word] = reader.current_vector

    When you access :meth:`~embfile.core.EmbFileCursor.current_vector` for the first time,
    the vector data is read/parsed and a vector is created; the vector remains
    accessible until a new word is read.

    **Creation.** Creating a reader usually implies the creation of a file object. That's why
    ``EmbFileReader`` implements the ``ContextManager`` interface so that you can use it inside
    a ``with`` clause. Nonetheless, a ``EmbFile`` keeps track of all its open readers and close them
    automatically when it is closed.
