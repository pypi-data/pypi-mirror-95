        CMS Machine Learning Group Python package
        =========================================
        
        The documentation of this Python package is hosted on `readthedocs <http://cmsml.readthedocs.io>`__.
        
        **However**, note that this documentation only covers the API and technical aspects of the package itself.
        Usage examples and further techniques for working with machine learning tools in CMS, alongside a collection of useful guidelines can be found in the `general CMS ML group documentation <https://cms-ml.github.io/documentation>`__.

        Docker images
        -------------
        
        To use the cmsml package via docker, checkour our `DockerHub <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/cmsml/cmsml>`__ which contains tags for several Python versions.
        
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        The tests can be triggered with
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
           python -m unittest tests
        
        and in general, they should be run for Python 2.7, 3.7 and 3.8. To run tests in a docker container, do
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
           # run the tests
           ./tests/docker.sh cmsml/cmsml
        
           # or interactively by adding a flag "i" to the command
           ./tests/docker.sh cmsml/cmsml i
           > python -m unittest tests
        
        In addition, before pushing to the repository, `PEP 8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__ compatibility should be checked with `flake8 <https://pypi.org/project/flake8/>`__
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
           ./tests/lint.sh
        
        or via using the docker container
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
           # run the tests
           ./tests/docker.sh cmsml/cmsml tests/lint.sh
