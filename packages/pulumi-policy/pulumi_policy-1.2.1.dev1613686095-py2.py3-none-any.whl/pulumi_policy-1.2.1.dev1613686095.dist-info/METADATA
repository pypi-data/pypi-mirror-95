# Pulumi Policy SDK

## Overview

Define and manage policy for cloud resources deployed through Pulumi.

Policy rules run during `pulumi preview` and `pulumi up`, asserting that cloud resource definitions
comply with the policy immediately before they are created or updated.

During `preview`, every rule is run on every resource, and policy violations are batched up
into a final report. During the update, the first policy violation will halt the deployment.

Policy violations can have enforcement levels that are **advisory**, which results in a printed
warning, or **mandatory**, which results in an error after `pulumi preview` or `pulumi up` completes.

## Getting Started

Please see [Get Started with Policy as Code](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/crossguard/) to get
started authoring and enforcing policies.

## Documentation

For additional documentation, guides, best practices, and FAQs, see [Policy as Code](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/guides/crossguard/).
