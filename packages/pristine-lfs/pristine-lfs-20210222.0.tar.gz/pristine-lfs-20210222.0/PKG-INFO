        About
        -----
        
        **pristine-lfs** is a tool to replace *pristine-tar* by the means of using
        Git LFS to store tarballs. The original *pristine-tar* tool is a way to store
        binary tarballs in Git by regenerating them using only a small binary delta
        file and a checkout of the upstream branch. On the contrary, *pristine-lfs*
        only uses the Git LFS storage, only uploading or downloading binary blobs as
        theyâ€™re needed, which helps reduce the Git repository size (compared to storing
        tarballs directly in Git) and the checkout times (compared to the plain Git LFS
        usage, which would download all tarballs each time the LFS-managed branch is
        checked out).
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        *pristine-lfs* assumes you have Python 3.6 or later installed as ``/usr/bin/python3``.
        
        *pristine-lfs* ships with a setup.py installer based on setuptools.
        To install *pristine-lfs*, simply type::
        
            ./setup.py install
        
        This will install *pristine-lfs* itself, its manpage and this README file into
        their proper locations.
        
        Alternatively, to install via ``pip``, run::
        
            pip install pristine-lfs
