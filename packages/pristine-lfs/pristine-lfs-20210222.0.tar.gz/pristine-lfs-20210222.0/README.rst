About
-----

**pristine-lfs** is a tool to replace *pristine-tar* by the means of using
Git LFS to store tarballs. The original *pristine-tar* tool is a way to store
binary tarballs in Git by regenerating them using only a small binary delta
file and a checkout of the upstream branch. On the contrary, *pristine-lfs*
only uses the Git LFS storage, only uploading or downloading binary blobs as
they’re needed, which helps reduce the Git repository size (compared to storing
tarballs directly in Git) and the checkout times (compared to the plain Git LFS
usage, which would download all tarballs each time the LFS-managed branch is
checked out).

Installation
------------

*pristine-lfs* assumes you have Python 3.6 or later installed as ``/usr/bin/python3``.

*pristine-lfs* ships with a setup.py installer based on setuptools.
To install *pristine-lfs*, simply type::

    ./setup.py install

This will install *pristine-lfs* itself, its manpage and this README file into
their proper locations.

Alternatively, to install via ``pip``, run::

    pip install pristine-lfs
