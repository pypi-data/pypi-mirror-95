# Multiplier for classification loss of a model. Faster AutoAugment uses classification loss to prevent augmentations
# from transforming images of a particular class to another class. The authors of Faster AutoAugment use 0.1 as
# default value.
task_factor: 0.1

# Multiplier for the gradient penalty for WGAN-GP training. 10 is the default value that was proposed in
# `Improved Training of Wasserstein GANs`.
gp_factor: 10

# Temperature for Relaxed Bernoulli distribution. The probability of applying a certain augmentation is sampled from
# Relaxed Bernoulli distribution (because Bernoulli distribution is not differentiable). With lower values of
# `temperature` Relaxed Bernoulli distribution behaves like Bernoulli distribution. In the paper, the authors
# of Faster AutoAugment used 0.05 as a default value for `temperature`.
temperature: 0.05

# Number of augmentation sub-policies. When an image passes through an augmentation pipeline, Faster AutoAugment
# randomly chooses one sub-policy and uses augmentations from that sub-policy to transform an input image. A larger
# number of sub-policies leads to a more diverse set of augmentations and better performance of a model trained on
# augmented images. However, an increase in the number of sub-policies leads to the exponential growth of a search
# space of augmentations, so you need more training data for Policy Model to find good augmentation policies.
num_sub_policies: 40

# Number of chunks in a batch. Faster AutoAugment splits each batch of images into `num_chunks` chunks. Then it
# applies the same sub-policy with the same parameters to each image in a chunk. This parameter controls the tradeoff
# between the speed of augmentation search and diversity of augmentations. Larger `num_chunks` values will lead to
# faster searching but less diverse set of augmentations. Note that this parameter is used only in the searching
# phase. When you train a model with found sub-policies, Albumentations will apply a distinct set of transformations
# to each image separately.
num_chunks: 4

# Number of consecutive augmentations in each sub-policy. Faster AutoAugment will sequentially apply `operation_count`
# augmentations from a sub-policy to an image. Larger values of `operation_count` lead to better performance of
# a model trained on augmented images. Simultaneously, larger values of `operation_count` affect the speed of search
# and increase the searching time.
operation_count: 4
