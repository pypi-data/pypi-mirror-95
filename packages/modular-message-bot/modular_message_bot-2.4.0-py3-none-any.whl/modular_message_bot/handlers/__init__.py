"""
Currently, we have pre modules, input modules, process modules and output modules. Each module is typically a wrapper
around something like an API. Please read the license for each module before using it. You are responsible for each
module you use!
Each input module uses interpolation to inject a "var" into a string which is then interpolated into output parameters.
