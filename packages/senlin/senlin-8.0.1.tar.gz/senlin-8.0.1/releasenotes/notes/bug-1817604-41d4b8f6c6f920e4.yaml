    [`bug 1817604 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/senlin/+bug/1817604>`_]
    Fixes major performance bugs within senlin by improving database
    interaction. This was completed by updating the database models to
    properly take advantage of relationships. Additionally removes
    unnecessary database calls and prefers joins instead to retrieve
    object data.
