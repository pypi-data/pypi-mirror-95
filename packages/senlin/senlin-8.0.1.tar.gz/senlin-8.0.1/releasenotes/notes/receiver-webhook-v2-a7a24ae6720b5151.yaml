    Added webhook v2 support:Previously webhook API introduced microversion 1.10
    to allow callers to pass arbritary data in the body along with the webhook
    call.  This was done so that webhooks would work with aodh again.
    However, aodh and most webhook callers cannot pass in the header necessary
    to specify the microversion. Thus, we introduce webhook v2 so that webhooks
    behave like    in microversion 1.10 but without the need to specify that
    microversion header.
