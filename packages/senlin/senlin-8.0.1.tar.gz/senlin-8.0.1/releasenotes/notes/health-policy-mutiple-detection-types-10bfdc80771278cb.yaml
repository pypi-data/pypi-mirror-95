    This release makes changes to the health policy properties that are
    incompatible with health policy v1.0.  Any existing policies of type
    health policy v1.0 must be removed before upgrading to this release.
    After upgrading, the health policies conforming to v1.0 must be recreated
    following health policy v1.1 format.
