    Fixes bug where the webhook rejected additional parameters in the body for
    mircoversion less than 1.10.  Now with new webhook version 2, additional
    parameters in the body will always be accepted regardless of the
    microversion API passed in.

    Introduces webhook version 2 that is returned when creating new webhook
    receivers.  Webhook version 1 receivers are still valid and will
    continue to be accepted.
