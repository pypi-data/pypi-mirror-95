features:
  - Health policy recovery actions now contains a list of dictionaries instead
    of a list of simple names. This is to make room for workflow invocations.
fixes:
  - The health policy recovery actions is designed to be a list but the current
    implementation can only handle one action. This is now explicitly checked.
