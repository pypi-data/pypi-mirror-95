fixes:
  - In openstacksdk 0.14.0 release, a bug related to SDK exception was fixed
    "https://review.openstack.org/#/c/571101/". With that change a SDK exception will contain the
    detailed message only if the message string is equal to 'Error'. Fixed the
    test_parse_exception_http_exception_no_details to use 'Error' as the exception message to make
    the test case pass.
