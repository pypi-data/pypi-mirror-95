    Senlin now support policy in code, which means if users didn't modify
    any of policy rules, they can leave policy file (in `json` or `yaml`
    format) empty or not deploy it at all. Because from now, Senlin keeps
    all default policies under `senlin/common/policies` module.
    Users can modify/generate `policy.yaml` file which will override policy
    rules in code if those rules show in `policy.yaml` file.
    Users also still use `policy.json` file but oslo team recommend that we
    should use the newer YAML format instead.

    Default `policy.json` file is now removed as Senlin now generate the
    default policies from code. Please be aware that when using that file in
    your environment.
