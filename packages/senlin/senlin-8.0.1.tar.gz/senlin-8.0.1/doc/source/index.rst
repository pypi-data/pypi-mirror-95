Welcome to the Senlin documentation!
====================================

1 Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Senlin is a service to create and manage :term:`cluster` of multiple cloud
resources. Senlin provides an OpenStack-native REST API and a AWS
AutoScaling-compatible Query API is in plan.

This section provides a detailed documentation for the concepts and built-in
policy types.

3.2 Built-in Policy Types
-------------------------

The senlin service is released with some built-in policy types that target
some common use cases. You can develop and deploy your own policy types by
following the instructions in the :ref:`developer-guide` section.

The following is a list of builtin policy types:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   user/policy_types/affinity
   user/policy_types/batch
   user/policy_types/deletion
   user/policy_types/health
   user/policy_types/load_balancing
   user/policy_types/scaling
   user/policy_types/region_placement
   user/policy_types/zone_placement

3.3 Built-in Profile Types
--------------------------

The senlin service is released with some built-in profile types that target
some common use cases. You can develop and deploy your own profile types by
following the instructions in the :ref:`developer-guide` section.

The following is a list of builtin profile types:

4 Usage Scenarios
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section provides some guides for typical usage scenarios. More scenarios
are to be added.

4.1 Managing Node Affinity
--------------------------

Senlin provides an :doc:`Affinity Policy <user/policy_types/affinity>` for
managing node affinity. This section contains a detailed introduction on how
to use it.

5. Developer's Guide

This section targets senlin developers.

5.2 Built-in Policy Types
-------------------------

Senlin provides some built-in policy types which can be instantiated and then
attached to your clusters. These policy types are designed to be orthogonal so
that each of them can be used independently. They are also expected to work
in a collaborative way to meet the needs of complicated usage scenarios.

5.3 Reviewing Patches
---------------------

There are many general guidelines across the community about code reviews, for
example:

- `Code review guidelines (wiki)`_
- `OpenStack developer's guide`_

Besides these guidelines, senlin has some additional amendments based on daily
review experiences that should be practiced.
