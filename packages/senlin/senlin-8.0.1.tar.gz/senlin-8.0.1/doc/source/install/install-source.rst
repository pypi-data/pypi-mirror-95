============================
Install from Git Source Code
============================

Install Senlin Server
---------------------

1. Get Senlin source code from OpenStack git repository.

::

  $ cd /opt/stack
  $ git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack/senlin.git

2. Install Senlin with required packages.

::

  $ cd /opt/stack/senlin
  $ sudo pip install -e .

3. Register Senlin clustering service with keystone.

   This can be done using the :command:`setup-service` script under the
   :file:`tools` folder.

   **NOTE:** Suppose you have devstack installed under the
   :file:`/opt/devstack` folder

::

  $ . /opt/devstack/openrc admin admin
  $ cd /opt/stack/senlin/tools
  $ ./setup-service <HOST IP> <SERVICE_PASSWORD>

4. Generate configuration file for the Senlin service.

::

  $ cd /opt/stack/senlin
  $ tools/gen-config
  $ sudo mkdir /etc/senlin
  $ sudo cp etc/senlin/api-paste.ini /etc/senlin
  $ sudo cp etc/senlin/senlin.conf.sample /etc/senlin/senlin.conf

Edit file :file:`/etc/senlin/senlin.conf` according to your system settings.
The most common options to be customized include:

::

  [database]
  connection = mysql+pymysql://senlin:<MYSQL_SENLIN_PW>@127.0.0.1/senlin?charset=utf8

  [keystone_authtoken]
  service_token_roles_required = True
  auth_type = password
  user_domain_name = Default
  project_domain_name = Default
  project_name = service
  username = senlin
  password = <SENLIN_PASSWORD>
  www_authenticate_uri = http://<HOST>/identity/v3
  auth_url = http://<HOST>/identity

  [authentication]
  auth_url = http://<HOST>:5000/v3
  service_username = senlin
  service_password = <SENLIN PASSWORD>
  service_project_name = service

  [oslo_messaging_rabbit]
  rabbit_userid = <RABBIT USER ID>
  rabbit_hosts = <HOST>
  rabbit_password = <RABBIT PASSWORD>

  [oslo_messaging_notifications]
  driver = messaging

For more comprehensive helps on configuration options, please refer to
:doc:`Configuration Options </configuration/index>` documentation.

In case you want to modify access policies of Senlin, please generate sample
policy file, copy it to `/etc/senlin/policy.yaml` and then update it.

::

  $ cd /opt/stack/senlin
  $ tools/gen-policy
  $ sudo cp etc/senlin/policy.yaml.sample /etc/senlin/policy.yaml

5. Create Senlin Database.

Create Senlin database using the :command:`senlin-db-recreate` script under
the :file:`tools` subdirectory. Before calling the script, you need edit it
to customize the password you will use for the ``senlin`` user. You need to
update this script with the <DB PASSWORD> entered in step4.

::

  $ cd /opt/stack/senlin/tools
  $ ./senlin-db-recreate

6. Start senlin engine and api service.

You may need two consoles for the services i.e., one for each service.

::

  $ senlin-engine --config-file /etc/senlin/senlin.conf
  $ senlin-api --config-file /etc/senlin/senlin.conf
