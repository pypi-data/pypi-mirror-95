Description: # Listcord.py
        
        An official wrapper for the listcord api!
        
        > View https://listcord.xyz/apidocs to view the raw api documentation!
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```sh
        pip install listcord.py
        ```
        
        ## Getting started
        
        > Get your api token from https://listcord.xyz/me. The Listcord api is currently only available only for those who have bots registered in our botlist! After getting your token, make sure your token is kept somewhere secret!
        
        ```py
        import listcord
        
        client = listcord.Client("Replace this with your token!")
        print(client.get_bot('some bot id'))
        ```
        
        This package also supports asynchronous fetching too!
        
        ```py
        import listcord
        import asyncio
        
        client = listcord.Client("Replace this with your token!")
        
        @asyncio.coroutine
        def main():
            bot = yield from client.get_bot_async('some bot id')
            print(bot)
        
        loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
        loop.run_until_complete(main())
        ```
        
        ## Methods
        
        There are only some methods with the asynchronous ones too!
        
        ```py
        client.get_bot('801976787264471120') # Returns the information of the bot!
        await client.get_bot_async('801976787264471120') # Returns the information of the bot asynchronously!
        
        client.get_bot_reviews('801976787264471120'); # Returns the array of reviews of the bot!
        await client.get_bot_reviews_async('801976787264471120'); # Returns the array of reviews of the bot asynchronously!
        
        client.get_review('user id', 'bot id'); # Returns the review details by the discord id of the reviewer and the bot which was reviewed!
        await client.get_review_async('user id', 'bot id'); # Returns the review details by the discord id of the reviewer and the bot which was reviewed asynchronously!
        
        client.has_voted('user id', 'bot id'); # Verify if the particular user has voted a paticular bot by id!
        await client.has_voted_async('user id', 'bot id'); # Verify if the particular user has voted a paticular bot by id asynchronously!
        
        client.search('shaz'); # Returns the array of the bots which matches your query!
        await client.search_async('shaz'); # Returns the array of the bots which matches your query aynchronously!
        ```
