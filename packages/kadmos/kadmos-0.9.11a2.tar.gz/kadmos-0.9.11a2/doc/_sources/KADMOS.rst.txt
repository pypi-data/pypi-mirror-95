Example scripts for using KADMOS are available in the examples/scripts folder. The following scripts are available there:

* ``Sellar Problem``: Small two-disciplinary analytical MDO problem based on MDO literature.
* ``Super-sonic Business Jet``: The jet design is decribed at http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19980234657.pdf and was implemented in Python for OpenMDAO by Sylvain Dubreuil and Remi Lafage of ONERA, the French Aerospace Lab.
* ``TU Delft Wing Design``: The wing design case described here was developed at TU Delft and takes a variety of different disciplines into account.
