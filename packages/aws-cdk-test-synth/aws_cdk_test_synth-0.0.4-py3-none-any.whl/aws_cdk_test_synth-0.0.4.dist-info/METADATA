Getting started
===============

AWS CDK test Synth package is implemented for helping you to test your AWS CDK code.

The goal is to cover the missing of an `official testing infrastructure <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/testing.html>`_ for **Python** as exists for **TypeScript** using `Jest <https://jestjs.io/>`_.

It is part of the `educational repositories <https://github.com/pandle/materials>`_ to learn how to write stardard code and common uses of the TDD.
