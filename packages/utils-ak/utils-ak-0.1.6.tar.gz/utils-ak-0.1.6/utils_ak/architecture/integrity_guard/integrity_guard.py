        I'm an abstraction. Extend me.

        I check if some operation has gone good or has crashed anywhere in the past.
        Usually, I raise some flags before entering the unstable area, and put it down upon leaving it.
        If I find a risen flag -- we've crashed at some point and need to take some actions.
        Those actions are out of our scope -- we just check.
