# pi3hat extensions for the moteus library #

This package enables the 'moteus' python package to communicate using
a pi3hat CAN-FD bridge.  By default, when installed, it exposes the
pi3hat as an available transport type to tools such as tview and
moteus_tool.  It also exposes the Pi3HatRouter class which can be
manually constructed in more complicated scenarios.
