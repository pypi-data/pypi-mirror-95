Description: DMAS RULE.
        Division, Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction (DMAS) is the elementary rule for the order of operation
        of the Binary operations. What is the scientific and technical reason behind this mathematical myth though
        Multiplication before Division also gives the same result mostly? DMAS, a nice tool but has less convincing/appealing
        to admit its order of operation.
        I am just Simply that the two number are taking enter from user and the applying the DMAS rule
