# NZXT E-series PSUs
_Driver API and source code available in [`liquidctl.driver.nzxt_epsu`](../liquidctl/driver/nzxt_epsu.py)._

## Initialization

It is necessary to initialize the device once it has been powered on.

```
# liquidctl initialize
```

_Note: at the moment initialize is a no-op, but this is likely to change once more features are added to the driver._


## Monitoring

The PSU is able to report monitoring data about its own hardware and the output rails.

```
# liquidctl status
