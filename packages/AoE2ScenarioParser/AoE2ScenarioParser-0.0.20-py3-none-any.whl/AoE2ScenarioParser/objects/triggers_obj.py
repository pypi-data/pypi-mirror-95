    triggers were copied for all players, display indexes of the copies from the first trigger would be 4-10. The second

    Group triggers by player. Warning: This mode could change some of the intended order of the triggers. All copies of
    the trigger will be put together sorted on player first, then trigger order. 
    Example: If the 'source' trigger has display_index of 3, and another trigger in it's tree has 5. Assuming the 
    triggers were copied for all players, display indexes of the copies from the firs trigger would be: 5, 7, 9, 11, 13,

    other player. 
    
    In the example above can be seen how the second trigger was moved from 5 to 4. The unrelated trigger in between was
    moved to the end, 19. This might be an unwanted side effect, be aware.
