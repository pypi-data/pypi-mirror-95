# osysid
Efficient adaptive online linear/nonlinear model learning (system identification) and control

To get started,
```
pip install osysid
```
This algorithm is based on the online dynamic mode decomposition algorithm, which is also available as a python package `pip install odmd`, see [here](https://github.com/haozhg/odmd).

## Showcase: Lorenz system control
[Lorenz system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) is one of the most classical nonlinear dynamical systems. Here we show how the proposed algorithm can be used to controll that. For more details, see [demo](https://github.com/haozhg/osysid/tree/master/demo).

### No control
If there is no control, we can see the mysterious butterfly trajectory. It starts close to the bottom plane and enters into the butterfly wing region, then oscillates there.

### With control
If we apply data-driven real-time closed loop control, it can be stabilized at an unstable fixed point (near the center of the butterfly wing).

## Highlights
- Efficiently online adaptive linear/nonlinear model learning. Any nonlinear and/or time-varying system is locally linear, as long as the model is updated in real-time wrt to measurement.
- Optimal in terms of both time and space complexity. The time complexity (multiplyâ€“add operation for one iteration) is O(n^2), and space complexity is O(n^2), where n is the problem dimension.
- This local model can be used for short-horizon prediction 
and real-time closed loop control.
- A weighting factor (in (0, 1]) can be used to place more weight on recent data, thus making the model more adaptive.

## Online system identification algorithm description
This is a brief introduction to the algorithm. For full technical details, see this [paper](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/18M1192329), and chapter 3 and chapter 7 of this [PhD thesis](http://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp0108612r49q).

### Unknown dynamical system
Suppose we have a (discrete) nonlinear and/or time-varying [dynamical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-space_representation), and the state space representation is
- x(t+1) = f(t, x(t), u(t))
- y(t) = g(t, x(t), u(t))

where t is (discrete) time, x(t) is state vector, u(t) is control (input) vector, y(t) is observation (output) vector. f(~, ~, \~) and g(~, ~, \~) are unknown vector-valued nonlinear functions.

- It is assumed that we have measurements x(t), u(t), y(t) for t = 0,1,...T. 
- However, we do not know functions f and g. 
- We aim to learn a model for the unknown dynamical system from measurement data up to time T.
- We want to the model to be updated efficiently in real-time as new measurement data becomes available.

### Online linear model learning
We would like to learn an adaptive [linear model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-space_representation)
- x(t+1) = A x(t) + B u(t)
- y(t) = C x(t) + D u(t)

that fits/explains the observation optimally. By Taylor expansion approximation, any nonlinear and/or time-varying system is linear locally. There are many powerful tools for linear control, e.g, [Linear Quadratic Regulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear%E2%80%93quadratic_regulator), [Kalman filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter). However, to accurately approximate the original (unknown) dynamical system, we need to update this linear model efficiently in real-time whenever new measurement becomes available.

This problem can be formulated as an optimization problem, and at each time step t we need to solve a related but slightly different optimization problem. The optimal algorithm is achived through efficient reformulation of the problem. 

- `osysid.OnlineLinearModel` class implements the optimal algorithm.

### Online nonlinear model learning
If we need to fit a nonlinear model to the observed data, this algorithm also applies in this case. However, notice that linear adaptive model is good approximation as long as it is updated in real-time. Also, the choice of nonlinear form can be tricky.

In particular, we want to fit a nonlinear model of this form
- x(t+1) = F * phi(x(t), u(t))
- y(t) = G * psi(x(t), u(t))

where phi(~, \~) and psi(~, \~) are known vector-valued nonlinear functions (e.g, quadratic) that we specify, F and G are unknown matrices of proper size. 

- We aim to learn F and G from measurement data. 
- Notice that this model form is general, and encompass many systems such as Lorenze attractor, Logistic map, Auto-regressive model, polynomial systems.
- F and G can be updated efficiently in real-time when new data comes in.

This can also be formulated as the same optimization problem, and the same efficient algorithm works in this case.

- `osysid.OnlineModel` class implements the optimal algorithm.
