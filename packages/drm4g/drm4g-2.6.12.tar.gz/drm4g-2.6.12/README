DRM4G is an open platform, based on GridWay, to define, submit,
and manage computational jobs. DRM4G is a Python (2.6+, 3.3+)
implementation that provides a single point of control for computing
resources without installing any intermediate middlewares. As a result,
a user is able to run the same job on laptops, desktops, workstations,
clusters, supercomputers, on any grid and cloud.
