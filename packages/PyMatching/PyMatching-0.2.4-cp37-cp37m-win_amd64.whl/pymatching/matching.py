        Parameters
        ----------
        H : `scipy.spmatrix` or `numpy.ndarray` or `networkx.Graph` object
            The quantum code to be decoded with minimum-weight perfect
            matching, given either as a binary check matrix (scipy sparse 
            matrix or numpy.ndarray), or as a matching graph (NetworkX graph).
            If `H` is given as a NetworkX graph with `M` nodes, each node 
            `m` in `H` should be an integer :math:`0<m<M-1`, and each node should 
            be unique. Each edge in the NetworkX graph can have optional 
            attributes ``qubit_id``, ``weight`` and ``error_probability``. 
            ``qubit_id`` should be an int or a set of ints. If there 
            are :math:`N` qubits then the union of all ints in the ``qubit_id`` 
            attributes in the graph should be the integers :math:`0\ldots N-1`.  
            Each ``weight`` attribute should be a non-negative float. If 
            every edge is assigned an error_probability between zero and one, 
            then the ``add_noise`` method can be used to simulate noise and 
            flip edges independently in the graph.
        spacelike_weights : float or numpy.ndarray, optional
            If `H` is given as a scipy or numpy array, `spacelike_weights` gives the weights
            of edges in the matching graph. By default None, in which case 
            all weights are set to 1.0
        error_probabilities : float or numpy.ndarray, optional
            The probabilities with which an error occurs on each qubit. If a 
            single float is given, the same error probability is used for each 
            qubit. If a numpy.ndarray of floats is given, it must have a 
            length equal to the number of qubits. This parameter is only 
            needed for the Matching.add_noise method, and not for decoding. 
            By default None
        repetitions : int, optional
            The number of times the stabiliser measurements are repeated, if 
            the measurements are noisy. This option is only used if `H` is 
            provided as a check matrix, not a NetworkX graph. By default None
        timelike_weights : float, optional
            If `H` is given as a scipy or numpy array and `repetitions>1`, 
            `timelike_weights` gives the weight of timelike edges. By default 
            None, in which case all weights are set to 1.0
        measurement_error_probability : float, optional
            If `H` is given as a scipy or numpy array and `repetitions>1`, 
            gives the probability of a measurement error to be used for 
            the add_noise method. By default None
        precompute_shortest_paths : bool, optional
            It is almost always recommended to leave this as False. If 
            the exact matching is used for decoding (setting 
            `num_neighbours=None` in `decode`), then setting this option
            to True will precompute the all-pairs shortest paths.
            By default False

            A binary syndrome vector to decode. The number of elements in

            (modulo 2) between the (noisy) measurement of stabiliser `i` in time 
            step `j+1` and time step `j` (for the case where `repetitions>1`).
        num_neighbours : int, optional

            then the local matching decoder in the Appendix of

            to leave `num_neighbours` set to at least 20.
            If `num_neighbours=None`, then instead full matching is 
            performed, with the all-pairs shortest paths precomputed and 
            cached the first time it is used. Since full matching is more 
            memory intensive, it is not recommended to be used for matching graphs 
            with more than around 10,000 nodes, and is only faster than 
            local matching for matching graphs with less than around 1,000 
            nodes. By default 20

            A 1D numpy array of ints giving the minimum-weight correction

            and an element is 1 if the corresponding qubit should be flipped,
