PyMatching
==========

PyMatching is a Python package for decoding quantum codes with the 
minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder, and is designed to 
be fast and easy to use. 

While a Python package such as NetworkX can also be used to 
implement MWPM, it is far too slow to be used for large 
fault-tolerance simulations, which often require 
matching graphs with many thousands of nodes. On the other hand, 
the widely used C++ BlossomV library is fast, but using it to decode 
quantum codes also requires path-finding algorithms, which must 
also be implemented in C++ for a fast implementation. Furthermore, 
attempting to solve the full matching problem even with BlossomV 
can become prohibitively expensive for matching graphs with more 
than a few thousand nodes, since the complexity is worse than 
quadratic in the number of nodes. BlossomV is also not 
open-source since it does not have a permissive license.

PyMatching is typically faster than a BlossomV/C++ implementation 
of the full matching problem, while being easy to use in conjunction 
with numpy, scipy and NetworkX using the Python bindings. 
The core algorithms and data structures are implemented in C++ 
for good performance (with the help of the open-source Lemon 
and Boost Graph libraries), using a local variant of the matching 
decoder given in the Appendix of https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09626, 
which empirically has an average runtime roughly linear in the number of nodes 
and gives the same output as full matching in practice. Since 
PyMatching uses the open-source Lemon C++ library for the Blossom algorithm,
which has similar performance to Kolmogorov's BlossomV library, both PyMatching and 
its dependencies have permissive licenses. PyMatching can be 
applied to any quantum code for which 
defects come in pairs (or in isolation at a boundary), 
and it does not require knowledge of the specific geometry 
used.

Compared to a pure Python NetworkX implementation of MWPM, PyMatching 
can be orders of magnitude faster, as shown here for the 
toric code under an independent noise model at :math:`p=0.05`:
