Description: AsyncAkumuli
        ============
        
        Welcome to `AsyncAkumuli <https://github.com/M-o-a-T/asyncakumuli>`__!
        
        This library contains a small async wrapper for submission of data to,
        and (rudimentary) reading from, `Akumuli <https://akumuli.org>`__.
        
        Also included:
        
        * A basic unit test
        * Test scaffolding, to easily test your own code
        * a utility to read the last timestamp, as Akumuli doesn't go backwards
        * helper code to interpred RRD / collectd input so that you can feed those
          to Akumuli
        * a couple of example scripts
        
        Tests and collectd support currently require Trio because (a) anyio doesn't
        support subprocesses, (b) UDP socket support in anyio is kindof limited.
