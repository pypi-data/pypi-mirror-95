# geanno: A package for region based annotation

pyanno is a python package that - given a list of genomic intervals - annotates these intervals to arbitrary genomic intervals of interest, as well as genes. The list of genomic intervals to be annotated, as well as the database interval regions of interest have to be encoded in a bed-like format.

## Example

### Base file
The base file of intervals, that will be annotated against a database of bed like files, that contain genomic intervals of interest has to be itself bed-like. It suffuces that the first three lines follow bed conventions, i.e. 
* 1st column: Chromosome
* 2nd column: Start position (0-based)
* 3rd column: End position (1-based)

The base interval entries can in addition contain an arbitrary number of additional columns.

```
# base.bed
#chrom	start	end
4       128887787       128887839
4       188862197       188862251
4       185746125       185746231
```

### Database file
The datbase file is a tab separated file, containing information about the genomic regions of interest, that shall be annotated to the base file. The database file contains the following information:
* **FILENAME**: Absolute path to the file 
* **REGION.TYPE**: E.g. protein.coding.genes, Enhancers, ...
* **SOURCE**: E.g., Cell type from which regions are derived
* **ANNOTATION.BY**: SOURCE | NAME
* **MAX.DISTANCE**: Maximal distance between base and database intervall, such that database intervall is anotated to base intervall.
* **DISTANCE.TO**: The location to which the distance shall be computed. Can be START | END | MID | REGION
* **N.HITS**: Integer value defining the number elements from the database that shall be annotated to the base
* **NAME.COL**: If ANNOTATION.BY == NAME, then you can define the column (0-based) in which the name is stored. If NAME.COL == NA, then it is assumed, that the 4th column contains the name.

The first line of the tsv file must contain the above **bold** column identifiers!

```
# database.tsv

#### Code example

```python
import pyanno
import pandas as pnd

database_filename = "database.tsv"
base_filename = "base.bed"
results_filename = "results.bed"

# Create a new GenomicRegionAnnotator instance
gra = pyanno.Annotator.GenomicRegionAnnotator()

# load base
gra.load_base_from_file(base_filename)

# load database
gra.load_database_from_file(database_filename)

# Annotate base against all database genomic region files
gra.annotate()

# Retrieve annotated base intervals as pandas.DataFrame instance
annotated_base_df = gra.get_base()

# Write annotated base intervals to disk
annotated_base_df.to_csv(results_filename, sep="\t", index=False)
```

#### Annotated results file
