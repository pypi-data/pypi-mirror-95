Description: Pyserini is a Python toolkit designed to support replicable information retrieval research.
        It provides sparse retrieval (e.g., BM25 ranking using bag-of-words representations), dense retrieval (e.g., nearest-neighbor search on transformer-encoded representations), as well hybrid retrieval that integrates both approaches.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install via PyPI:
        
        ```
        pip install pyserini
        ```
        
        Pyserini requires Python 3.6+.
        
        ## Usage
        
        The `SimpleSearcher` class provides the entry point for sparse retrieval using bag-of-words representations.
        Anserini supports a number of pre-built indexes for common collections that it'll automatically download for you and store in `~/.cache/pyserini/indexes/`.
        Here's how to use a pre-built index for the [MS MARCO passage ranking task](http://www.msmarco.org/) and issue a query interactively (using BM25 ranking):
        
        ```python
        from pyserini.search import SimpleSearcher
        
        searcher = SimpleSearcher.from_prebuilt_index('msmarco-passage')
        hits = searcher.search('what is a lobster roll?')
        
        for i in range(0, 10):
            print(f'{i+1:2} {hits[i].docid:7} {hits[i].score:.5f}')
        ```
        
        The results should be as follows:
        
        ```
         1 7157707 11.00830
         2 6034357 10.94310
         3 5837606 10.81740
         4 7157715 10.59820
         5 6034350 10.48360
         6 2900045 10.31190
         7 7157713 10.12300
         8 1584344 10.05290
         9 533614  9.96350
        10 6234461 9.92200
        ```
