Description: # iot.io Server
        ### iot.io Overview
        This project aims to create a lightweight and intuitive system for connecting
        IoT devices to a central server for small IoT system implementations and hobbyists.
        
        The framework focuses on providing easy to use system of libraries so the end user does
        not need to understand the protocol implementation, though this also is fairly simple.
        
        The format of the framework is somewhat reminiscent of [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) 
        where handlers functions are defined and executed and run as events are triggered.
        
        
        ### Quickstart Guide (Server)
        This is an example of a simple IoTManager instance which accepts a "EhcoClient"
        and will print every message the client sends out to console.
        
        ```python
        from flask import Flask
        from iotio import IoTManager, DeviceType, IoTClient
        from eventlet import wsgi
        import eventlet
        """
        Example implementation of a Echo server.
        
        Defines an EchoClient of type 'echo'.
        Works with the corresponding 'echo' iot.io-client example.
        """
        
        # create a flask app
        app = Flask("Echo Example")
        
        # create an instance of the IoTManager
        manager = IoTManager(app)
        
        
        # define the EchoClient device
        class EchoClient(DeviceType):
            def on_connect(self, client: IoTClient):
                print("EchoClient Connected! ID: " + client.id)
        
            # define a handler for when the client receives a "echo" event
            def on_echo(self, message: str, client: IoTClient):
                print("Message from Client of type '" + self.type + "' with ID '" + client.id + "': '", message, "'")
        
                # respond to client with the 'echo_response' event
                return "echo_response", message
        
            def on_disconnect(self, client: IoTClient):
                print("EchoClient Disconnected! ID: " + client.id)
        
        
        # add the device type to the manager
        manager.add_type(EchoClient("echo"))
        
        # run the server using eventlet
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            wsgi.server(eventlet.listen(('0.0.0.0', 5000)), app)
        ```
