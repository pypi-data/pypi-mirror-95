Level File Format
=================

All comments up until the [name] and [last_level] tags are ignored.

Level Pack Tags
===============

The [name] tag: A name for the pack e.g. MyLevels-01 (up to 11 letters and no spaces).

The [last_level] tag: The number of levels in the pack.

The [default_level_colour] tag: A default level colour that can be used throughout the
entire pack if any or all individual level [colour] tags are undefined; OPTIONAL.

The [notes] tag: Notes about the entire level pack; OPTIONAL.

Level Tags
==========

Sometimes an [offset] tag exists. It was created while taking the levels from Atari.
These tags can be removed without any problems.

The [level] tag: Level number.

The [colour] tag: Hexadecimal RGB background colour. If this is missing then the colour
will come from the [default_level_colour] if defined; OPTIONAL.

The [size] tag: Map width, map height.

The [screws] tag: Number of screws robbo needs to enter capsule. This can be different
from the number of screws placed in the level. This tag is ignored by older versions of
GNU Robbo. If this is missing then the needed number of screws will be the number of
screws placed in the level; OPTIONAL.
area
The [author] tag: The author of the level; OPTIONAL.

The [level_notes] tag: Notes about the level; OPTIONAL.

The [data] tag: Object identifiers for the complete map (see the list above for the
legends).

The [additional] tag: This is where additional data is placed that describes the behaviour
of certain objects if applicable.

The first number is the object (lines) count. Following this is a line for each object.
All the objects start with an x position, a y position and a symbol from the above list
followed by any number of additional parameters depending on which object it is describing.

Teleport example: 13.2.&.1.0 would give you a teleport at 13x 2y with 7.2.&.1.1 giving
you it's first group partner at 7x 2y (there could be other teleports that are part of
this group and they would be 1.2, 1.3 etc. If you want another group somewhere else then
the first teleport would be 2.0, its first partner 2.1 and so on.

Gun example: 13.10.}.1.1.1.0.0.0 (looks scary but it isn't :) ) would give you a gun at
13x 10y which has direction (is facing) south (0=east|1=south|2=west|3=north). The next
value (1) describes the direction in which the gun is moving if moveable. The next value
(1) states that this is a solid laser (0=burst|1=solid|2=blaster). The next value (0)
describes this gun as unmoveable (0=unmoveable|1=moveable) with the last two zeros stating
non-rotateable and non-random-rotateable.

The bear follows the left-hand maze traversal rule and will go left if possible else it'll
go forward. You can think of this as when it's going clockwise it's pushing outwards and
when going anti-clockwise it's pulling inwards.

The black bear follows the right-hand maze traversal rule and will go right if possible
else it'll go forward. You can think of this as when it's going clockwise it's pulling
inwards and when going anti-clockwise it's pushing outwards.

The initial positioning and/or direction of both bears is important. If neither of them
have entries in this section then their default direction will be 0 (east) and this may
suffice depending on where they are placed.

The bird has a movement direction, a shot direction and 0 or 1 describing if it is shooting
or not.

The magnets have a direction of 0=east, 1=south, 2=west and 3=north.

The force fields have a direction of 0=east and 2=west only and they are contained by either
a wall or the edges of the level. Everything else they will consume.

The [end] tag: Defines the end of the level data.
