PyRobbo
=======

This is a clone of an old 8-bit Atari game Robbo, written in PyGame.

A little robot needs to collect all parts of his capsule and escape
hostile planets.

The game has been originally written for Atari XE/XL by Janusz Pelc
from "LK. Avalon".

Graphics and level data are taken from the gnurobbo project
(http://gnurobbo.sourceforge.net/).
