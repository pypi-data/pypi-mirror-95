    -----
    SPC files contained 1D spectra, opt.SPC files contained optimally extracted
    spectra using gaussian profiles STP files contain 2D stamps.
    CONT files contain the gaussian based contamination estimate

    This test should produce STP FITS files where each stamp is contained in
    its own extension. All output files should be in the directory pointed to
