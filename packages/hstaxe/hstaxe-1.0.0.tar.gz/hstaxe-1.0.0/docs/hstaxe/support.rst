Support
===========================

History
---------------
The Space Telescope - European Coordinating Facility (STECF)
was responsible for supporting the slitless spectroscopic modes
of the Hubble instruments ACS and WFC3 until 2011

After that time, all support (simulation and extraction software, calibration
and user support) has been provided by (STScI).
