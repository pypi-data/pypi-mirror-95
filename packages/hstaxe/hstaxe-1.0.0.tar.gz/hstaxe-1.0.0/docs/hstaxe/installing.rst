Installing hstaxe
=================

Package Structure
-----------------

The hstaxe software is composed of a combination of routines written in
ANSI-C and python. Many of the python modules use the C executables to
do their work, while some perform all operations within the python
module itself. The C executables reside in the cextern directory, 
while the python source routines reside in hstaxe tree.


hstaxe Distribution
-------------------

hstaxe is distributed through PyPI and can be installed from the GitHub source repository.



Validating the aXe installation
-------------------------------

Test data with WFC3 and ACS grism images, as well ACS prism
images, can be obtained from the aXe web site at
http://axe.stsci.edu/axe/testdata.html. Unzip and untar the test data
file in a clean directory and follow the instructions given in the
README file. The ACS grism test data consist of a set of science frames
taken from the HUDF HRC Parallels program. 

The prism test data was taken as part of the calibration proposal 10391 (PI: S.S. Larsen).

The WFC3 test data originates from the WFC3 Early Release Science programm (PID: 11359, PI: O'Connell)

Reference spectra generated by running aXe on the test data are also
supplied as part of the test packages. If the output obtained by running
aXe on the test data is identical to these reference spectra, the proper
working of aXe is assured.

hstaxe Support
--------------

The aXe sofware package was originally developed by a dedicated group at
the Space Telescope - European Coordinating Facility (STECF). STECF
supported the use of the aXe software and the slitless spectroscopic
modes of ACS and WFC3 until late 2010. Since the beginning of 2011
support has been provided by STScI.

hstaxe was created after support for IRAF and PyRAF was no longer possible.
This package is based purely in Python and C.
