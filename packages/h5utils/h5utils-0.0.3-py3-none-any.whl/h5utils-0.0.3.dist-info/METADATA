h5utils Package
===============

*h5utils* is a python package adding extra functionality missing from `MIT's h5utils <https://h5utils.readthedocs.io/>`_.

HDF5_ (Hierarchical Data Format 5) is a file format for storing scientific data.

The tools in the h5utils package allow converting other formats from and to HDF5 and to visualize HDF5 files.

They include:

* h5tovts, which converts HDF5 files to structured VTK files for
  visualization with VTK-aware programs. This is particularly useful to visualize HDF5 output files from MPB_.
