# scholarly

scholarly is a module that allows you to retrieve author and publication information from [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) in a friendly, Pythonic way.

## Important Note

This is version 1.1 of the `scholarly` library. There has been a major refactor in the way the library operates and it's code structure and it **will break** most existing code, based on the previous versions.

## Documentation

Check the [documentation](https://scholarly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) for a complete reference and a quickstart quide.

## Installation

Use `pip` to install from pypi:

```bash
pip3 install scholarly
```

or `pip` to install from github:

```bash
pip3 install -U git+https://github.com/OrganicIrradiation/scholarly.git
```

## Tests

### Run the tests

To run tests execute the `test_module.py` file as:

```bash
python3 test_module
```

or

```bash
python3 -m unittest -v test_module.py
```
