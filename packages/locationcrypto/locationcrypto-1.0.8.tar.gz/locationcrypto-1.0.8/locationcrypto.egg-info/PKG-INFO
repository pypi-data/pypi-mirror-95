        Location based cryptography uses location of the device in addition to pass-phrase as encryption/decryption key.
        
        #### Install:
        ```bash
        pip install locationcrypto
        ```
        
        #### Use:
        Create a python script, for example **`example.py`**:
        ```python
        from locationcrypto import crypt
        ```
        To encrypt:
        ```python
        encryption = crypt.encrypt(plain_text='Harshil', key='test')
        print(f'Encryption: {encryption}')
        ```
        To decrypt:
        ```python
        decryption = crypt.decrypt(encrypted_text=encryption, key='test')
        print(f'Decryption: {decryption}')
        ```
        Save and run:
        ```bash
        ❯❯❯ python3 example.py
        Encryption: Jevujhk
        Decryption: Harshil
