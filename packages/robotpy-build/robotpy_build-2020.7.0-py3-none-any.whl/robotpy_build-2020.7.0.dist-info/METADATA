robotpy-build
=============

This is a build tool designed to meet the needs of RobotPy's various wrapper
libraries build needs, chiefly around:

* Managing upstream binary dependencies
* Autogenerating pybind11 wrappers around those dependencies
* Building wheels from those generated wrappers

robotpy-build is intended to be a generally useful build tool for any python
project that has binary dependencies. If you find that isn't the case, please
report a bug on github.

Requires Python 3.6+
