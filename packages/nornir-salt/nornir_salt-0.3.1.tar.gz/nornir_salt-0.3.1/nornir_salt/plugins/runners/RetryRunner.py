"""
RetryRunner plugin
##################

RetryRunner plugin implements retry logic to improve task execution reliability.

.. warning:: For grouped tasks need to explicitly provide `connection_name` attribute 
    such as `netmiko`, `napalm`, `scrapli`. Specifying `connection_name` attribute for 
    standalone tasks not required. Lack of `connection_name` attribute will result in skipping 
    connection retry logic and connections to all hosts initiated simultaneously up to the 
    number of `num_workers`

RetryRunner Architecture

RetryRunner Sample Usage
========================

Need to instruct Nornir to use RetryRunner on instantiation::

    from nornir import InitNornir

    NornirObj = InitNornir(
        runner={
            "plugin": "RetryRunner",
            "options": {
                "num_workers": 100,
                "num_connectors": 10,
                "connect_retry": 3,
                "connect_backoff": 1000,
                "connect_splay": 100,
                "task_retry": 3,
                "task_backoff": 1000,
                "task_splay": 100
            }
        }

RetryRunner - Connect to hosts behind jumphost
==============================================

RetryRunner implements logic to connect with hosts behind bastion/jumphosts.

.. note:: Only Netmiko tasks, `connection_name="netmiko"`, support connecting via Jumphosts.

To connect to devices behind jumphost, need to define jumphost parameters in host's inventory data::

    hosts:
      R1:
        hostname: 192.168.1.151
        platform: ios
        username: test
        password: test
        data:
          jumphost:
            hostname: 10.1.1.1
            port: 22
            password: jump_host_password
            username: jump_host_user
