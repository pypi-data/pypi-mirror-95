upgrade:
  - |
    The previously deprecated options ``api_host``, ``api_port``, ``host`` and
    ``port`` have been permanently removed and are replaced by ``listen``.

    e.g.

    .. code-block:: ini

      [service:api]
      listen = 0.0.0.0:9001

    ..

    The Designate ``sink`` service will now use the heartbeat reporting system to
    report its status. This was already the case for all other Designate
    services.
