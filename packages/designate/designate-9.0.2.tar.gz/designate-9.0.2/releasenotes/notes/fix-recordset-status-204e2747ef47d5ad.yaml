    Fixed a bug with the recordset status implementation to make it report
    its status more accurately.

    A recordset will now always report its highest priority state when it
    contains multiple records. The order of priority is,
    `ERROR`, `PENDING`, `ACTIVE` and `DELETED`.

    See `bug 1842994`_ for more information.
