    Designate now support policy in code, which means if users don't want to
    modify any of policy rules, they can remove or comment all of rules in
    policy file or even not deploy it at all. Because from now, Designate keeps
    all default policies under `designate/common/policies` module.
    Users can modify/generate `policy.yaml` file which will override policy
    rules in code if those rules show in `policy.yaml` file.
    Users also still use `policy.json` file but oslo team recommend that we
    should use the newer YAML format instead.

    Default `policy.json` file is now removed as Designate now generate the
    default policies from code. Please be aware that when using that file in
    your environment.
