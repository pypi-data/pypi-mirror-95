    TXT and SPF records are now validated for empty spaces in the values.
    If record value has empty space it should use "" quotation according to
    RFC-1035 section 5.1. Use of single quotation mark within record value
    requires quote symbol to be escaped with backslash.

    See `bug 1755788`_ for more information.
