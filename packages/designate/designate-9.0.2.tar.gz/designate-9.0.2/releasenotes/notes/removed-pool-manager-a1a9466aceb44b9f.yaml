    Pool-Manager removal is complete in this version of designate.
upgrade:
  - |
    The pool-manager has been removed and can no longer be used. Instead
    the worker and producer service should be used.

    Because of this the ``[service:worker]`` option ``enabled`` has been
    permanently removed, and in addition the ``notify`` option under the same
    section has been deprecated for removal.
