    Designate-Sink service now supports notification listener pooling
    for those oslo.messaging drivers that support this feature
    (currently those are ``rabbit``/``kombu`` and ``kafka``).
    `Listener pools <https://docs.openstack.org/oslo.messaging/latest/reference/notification_listener.html>`_
    is an alternative to specifying several topics for notification consumers
    in configuration of service that emits notifications.

    To enable listener pooling, set the option
    ``[service:sink]listener_pool_name`` to some string value, that must be the
    same for all designate-sink service instances.
    Default value of this option (``None``) disables notification listener
    pooling.
