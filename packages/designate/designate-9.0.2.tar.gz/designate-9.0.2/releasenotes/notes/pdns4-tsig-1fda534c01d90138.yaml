    Adds a new option for pools using the ``pdns4`` backend: ``tsigkey_name``.
    This allows deployers to specify a tsig key that is installed in powerdns
    to use for AFXR requests. This key name is the name used to create the key
    in powerdns, not the Designate UUID based ID for the key.

    .. note:: This is only available in the 4.2.x versions (and above) of pdns.
