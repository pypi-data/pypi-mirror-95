Description: Blythooon is a powershell script based (net-) installer for semi-automatically creating a Python runtime environment comprising also and in particular:
        
         + Python      2.7.18
         + Virtualenv 20.2.2
         + PySide      1.2.2
         + NumPy       1.16.6
         + PyQtGraph   0.10.0
         + Matplotlib  2.2.5
         + SciPy       1.1.0
         + PySerial    3.5
         + Pyadaaah    0.90
        
        (Blythooon yet is available/working just for Windows 10). Said Python runtime environment has everything on board to run high quality scientific applications with GUIs based on Qt 4.8.
        
        
        Download and save this Blythooon-ZIP-archive anywhere on your PC, unzip it resp. extract it's contents and then start the installation process by double-clicking the file "blythooonInstaller.bat". You might need administrator privileges or/and you might have to temporarily disable your firewall before that.
        
        
        After said installation you can find the python.exe in the path:
        
        $home\Blythooon\Environments\PysideGui\Scripts\python.exe
        
        whereby $home is the path to your home directory (e.g. C:\Users\DN).
        
        
        At the end of the installation process the Blythooon-Test program is started. If all buttons are green (and not yellow or red instead), your Blythooon environment seems to work (resp. your installation seems to have worked).
        
        
        If you e.g. want to install further packages into said Python environment, you can do so by:
        
        $home\Blythooon\Environments\PysideGui\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install packageName
        
        whereby packageName stands for any valid packageName e.g. from pypi.org. . Naturally you can also use other pip commands alike 'pip list' in the same way.
        
        
        Please note, that you also can run the Blythooon installer powershell script using the cmd console, by e.g. typing (navigate to the belonging directory before that):
        
        powershell -executionpolicy bypass .\blythooon.ps1 -license
        
        
        Available options are:
        
        blythooon.ps1
        blythooon.ps1 -download
        blythooon.ps1 -download -verbose
        blythooon.ps1 -check
        blythooon.ps1 -install
        blythooon.ps1 -uninstall
        blythooon.ps1 -help
        blythooon.ps1 -license
        
        Have fun...
