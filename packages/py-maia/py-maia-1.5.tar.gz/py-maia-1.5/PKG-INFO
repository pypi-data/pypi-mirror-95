        ## About "maia"
        This python module was created to make code clear and easy.<br/>
        This page will be updated quite often, like the project itself, so I recommend checking for updates often</br>
        You can install this package by using a simple command:
        > pip install py-maia
        
        And import this package using
        > import maia
        
        ## Version 1.5
        **19 February 2021**
        
        ### switch & case
        That just popular method of iterating, which unfortunately was not added to this language
        But in this function I tried to add this functionality in Python
        
            from maia import switch
        
            x = 10
            for case in switch(x):
                if case(0):
                    print('num is 0')
                    break
                elif case(10):
                    print('num is 10')
                    break
                else:
                    print('num not in list')
                    break
        
        ### Loadings & printr
        Now you can use loadings in your project!
        
            from maia import Loading, printr
            import time
        
            for x in Loading.user_load(['x', 'b', 'c'], desc='Object: %'):
                printr(x)
                time.sleep(1)
            print('All objets done.')
        
        Or you can load a usual one
        
            from maia import Loading, printr
            import time
        
            for x in Loading.usual(xrange=range(0, 100)):
                printr(x)
                time.sleep(0.01)
        
        So, what about "printr()" func? This function allows you to edit
        last line into new line. It can be helpful in many situations then you need
        to work with a console, so use it :)
        
        ### Photo
        Now you can load photo from wedsite using just a one simple line
        > Photo(path).download(link)
        
        I will add some more functions in this class later 
        
        ## Version 1.1
        ### AutoInstaller
        That function will help you install packages without using a console command "pip install ..."<br/>
        ***Example:***
        
            from maia import AutoInstaller
            try:
                import colorama
            except ImportError:
               AutoInstaller()
            print("Hello, AutoInstaller" + colorama.Fore.GREEN)
        
        ## Version 1.0
        Just crashed package, so you can just skip it
