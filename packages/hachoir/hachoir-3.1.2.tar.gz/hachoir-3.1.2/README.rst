Hachoir is a Python library to view and edit a binary stream field by field.
In other words, Hachoir allows you to "browse" any binary stream just like you
browse directories and files.

A file is splitted in a tree of fields, where the smallest field is just one
bit. Examples of fields types: integers, strings, bits, padding types, floats,
etc. Hachoir is the French word for a meat grinder (meat mincer), which is used
by butchers to divide meat into long tubes; Hachoir is used by computer
butchers to divide binary files into fields.
