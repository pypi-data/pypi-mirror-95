Filetree definitions for the FSL neuroimaging library.

Add new filetree definitions to the file_tree_fsl/trees directory.

After installation of these filetrees (`pip install file-tree-fsl`), 
you do not have to import this library. `file-tree` will detect
it automatically and these trees will be available to load directly
or as sub-trees.
