Description: 
        # xls2moodle
        Script to convert multiple choice questions from xls to moodle's xml format. The xml format
        can then be used to import the questions into moodle quizes. Please note, that this repository
        and the code was intended to be used for german tables / quizes. Adaptions are possible, but
        some columns (in the input) are hard-coded at the moment.
        
        To install the package and make use of the tkinter GUI (thanks @euvbonk), you can use 
        
        >pip install xls2moodle
        
        ## input
        The script requires two arguments as commandline options (see MoodleXML usage):
        - course name
        - location of tabular excel file with questions
        
        ## output
        - xml format, ready for import in moodle
        
        ## question format
        
        Please refer to the template_advanced.xlsx to get an ideao on the file format.
        Mandatory columns:
        - Aussage1 - possible answer 1
        - Aussage2 - possible answer 2
        - Aussage3 - possible answer 3
        - Aussage4 - possible answer 4
        - WAHR - contains index of correct answer(s), 1-based
        - FALSCH - contains index of wrong answer(s), 1-based
        - Themenblock - contains a topic name (this should be the same for similar questions)
        - Hauptfrage - Question text
        
        Optional columns:
        - Anwendung - boolean, filter to include (1) or exclude (0) questions
        
        Further columns are ignored.
        
        ## templates
        The script reads templates (xml_templates-folder) that were previously exported from moodle.
        If the format changes in the future, this process needs to be repeated. In the meantime, do
        not touch any of the xml templates.
        
        ## known issues
        - latex equation code supported (?)
        - reading of data with special encoding (utf-8) currently not possible with the latest pandas version
