## Typing stubs for redis

This is an auto-generated PEP 561 type stub package for `redis` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `redis`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/redis. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

This package was generated from typeshed commit `1d1d35c87af28cec08d049561c3baf13532f98d4`.
