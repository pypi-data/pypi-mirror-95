General
========
Hydrograph Generator 2.0 (HydroGen2.0): stochastic generation of domestic water events. The program stochastically generates domestic water events according to user-given probability distributions. The output file ``OutputFile.csv`` is meant to be used as input for the WaterHub Modelica package (see project WaterHub_ for more information).

HydroGen2.0 is still under heavy development.
