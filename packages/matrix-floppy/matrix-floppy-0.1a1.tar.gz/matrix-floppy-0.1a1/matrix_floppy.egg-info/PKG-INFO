        ===============
        
        Save your Matrix history.
        
        Motivation
        ----------
        
        My motivation for writing this application is to give me an offline browseable
        and searchable archive of my Matrix chat history. This can be handy if my
        homeserver is down, or if I want to move homeserver, or just to be able to
        search encrypted chat history without needing to use Element Desktop.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        I've never used it before, but I'm using pipenv for this project. I'll update
        this section once I've figured it out myself.
