Juju verify
===========

This CLI tool is a Juju plugin that allows user to check whether it's safe
to perform some disruptive maintenance operations on Juju units, like `shutdown`
or `reboot`.

Supported charms
----------------

* nova-compute (WIP)
* ceph-osd (WIP)

Supported checks
----------------

* reboot
* shutdown

**NOTE:** Final list of supported checks and what they represent is still WIP

Usage example
-------------

To verify that it is safe to stop/shutdown units `nova-compute/0` and
`nova-compute/1` without affecting the rest of the OpenStack cloud environment,
run the following.

```bash
$ juju-verify shutdown nova-compute/0 nova-compute/1
```

**NOTE:** If you run check on multiple units at the same time, they must all run
the same charm. Trying, for example, `juju-verify shutdown nova-compute/1
ceph-osd/0` will result in error.

How to contribute
-----------------

Is your favorite charm missing from the list of supported charm? Don't hesitate
to add it. This plugin is easily extensible.

All you need to do is create new class in `juju_verify.verifiers` package that
inherits from `juju_verify.verifiers.BaseVerifier` (see the class documentation for
more details) and implement the necessary logic.

Then, the charm name needs to be added to `SUPPORTED_CHARMS` dictionary in
`juju_verify/verifiers/__init__.py` *et voil√†*, the charm is now supported.

Don't forget to add unit and functional tests, and run:

```bash
make test
```

TODO
----

* Check if machine runs other principal unties aside from those that are being
  checked

* Allow targeting Juju machines, not just units for checks. e.g.
  `juju-verify shutdown --machine 0`
