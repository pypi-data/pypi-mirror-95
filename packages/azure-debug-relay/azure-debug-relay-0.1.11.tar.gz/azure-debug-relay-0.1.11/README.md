# Azure Debug Relay for Python

Azure Debug Relay - is a [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension and a Python package for distributed remote debugging.

* [Azure Debug Relay extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VladKolesnikov-vladkol.azure-debug-relay) on Visual Studio Marketplace
* [azure-debug-relay](https://pypi.org/project/azure-debug-relay/) package on PyPI

Azure Debug Relay uses [debugpy](https://github.com/microsoft/debugpy) and [Azure Relay](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-relay/relay-what-is-it) service to create a debugging tunnel between 2 machines:

1. You local Visual Studio Code debugger in `listen` mode.
1. You remote code in `attach` mode.

Both machines can be isolated behind NAT or virtual networks - all they need is to be able to connect to Azure Relay resource.
Azure Relay carries a secure tunnel, just as if these machines were in the same VPN.

The debugging tunnel is handled by **[Azure Relay Bridge](https://github.com/vladkol/azure-relay-bridge)** utility which is downloaded and installed automatically by Azure Debug Relay. Azure Relay Bridge can maintain secure TCP and UDP tunnels for different purposes.

> We currently use a private fork of [Azure Relay Bridge](https://github.com/Azure/azure-relay-bridge) repo.

## Requirements

* Python 3.6+
* debugpy 1.2.1+
* Visual Studio Code 1.34+ (for using VS Code extension)

Azure Relay Bridge tool is a .NET Core application, so you may need  to install `apt-transport-https` and other .NET Core 3.1 Runtime prerequisites on [Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux) and [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows?tabs=netcore31).

> You don't have to install .NET Runtime itself - Azure Relay Bridge builds are self-contained.

### Supported Operating Systems

* Ubuntu 18+
* Debian 10+
* macOS 10+
* Windows 10

## Installation

**On the debugger side (usually your dev machine with Visual Studio code)**:

> Install [Azure Debug Relay extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VladKolesnikov-vladkol.azure-debug-relay) from Visual Studio Marketplace.

**On the server side**:

> `python3 -m pip install azure-debug-relay`

## Usage

Before you start debugging with Azure Debug Relay, there are 3 places you configure it:

1. Azure Portal.
1. Local machine where you run Visual Studio Code and its Python debugger.
1. Remote machine where you run the same code files that open locally in VS Code.

### In Azure Portal

1. [Create Azure Relay resource](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Relay). Better make one in a region closest to your location.
1. Once created, switch to the resource, and select `Hybrid Connections` option in the vertical panel.
1. Add a hybrid connection (`+ Hybrid Connection` button), give it a memorable name (e.g. `test` ðŸ™‚) - this is your **Relay Name**.
1. Switch to that new hybrid connection, then select `Shared Access Policies` in the vertical panel.
1. Add a new policy with `Send` and `Listen` permissions.
1. Once created, copy its `Primary Connection String`, this is your **Connection String**.

#### **Azure CLI version**

Choose your name instead of `mydebugrelay1` for an Azure Relay resource, and your custom name for Hybrid Connection instead of `debugrelayhc1`.

```cmd
az group create --name debugRelayResourceGroup --location westus2

az relay namespace create --resource-group debugRelayResourceGroup --name mydebugrelay1 --location westus2

az relay hyco create --resource-group debugRelayResourceGroup --namespace-name mydebugrelay1 --name debugrelayhc1

az relay hyco authorization-rule create --resource-group debugRelayResourceGroup --namespace-name mydebugrelay1 --hybrid-connection-name debugrelayhc1 --name sendlisten --rights Send Listen

az relay hyco authorization-rule keys list --resource-group debugRelayResourceGroup --namespace-name mydebugrelay1 --hybrid-connection-name debugrelayhc1 --name sendlisten
```

Last command will show you something like this:

```json
{
  "keyName": "sendlisten",
  "primaryConnectionString": "Endpoint=sb://mydebugrelay1.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=sendlisten;SharedAccessKey=REDACTED1;EntityPath=debugrelayhc1",
  "primaryKey": "REDACTED1",
  "secondaryConnectionString": "Endpoint=sb://mydebugrelay1.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=sendlisten;SharedAccessKey=REDACTED2;EntityPath=debugrelayhc1",
  "secondaryKey": "REDACTED2"
}
```

Use `primaryConnectionString` or `secondaryConnectionString` value as your **Connection String**.

**Relay Name** would be the one you choose instead of `debugrelayhc1`.
</details>

### Remotely with `remote_server_demo.py` or your code

Remote Server example (in `samples/simple_demo/remote_server_demo.py`) assumes that Azure Relay credentials will are passes via `.azrelay.json` file in the current directory or via environment variables. Therefore, you have 2 options:

**Option 1**: Create `.azrelay.json` file in your workspace directory root or whatever directory will be "current",
and set 2 variables:

1. `AZRELAY_CONNECTION_STRING` to your **Connection String**.
1. `AZRELAY_NAME` to your **Relay Name**.

For example:

```json
{
  "AZRELAY_CONNECTION_STRING": "Endpoint=sb://mydebugrelay1.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=sendlisten;SharedAccessKey=REDACTED1;EntityPath=debugrelayhc1",
  "AZRELAY_NAME": "debugrelayhc1"
}
```

Make sure you add `.azrelay.json` to `.gitignore` so won't be committed.

**Option 2**: You can assign these 2 variables as environment variables: `AZRELAY_CONNECTION_STRING` and `AZRELAY_NAME` instead.

### Prepare local Visual Studio Code

Use `.azrelay.json` file in the root of your workspace as above or `.vscode/settings.json` with the following settings (actual values are ones you have):

```json
{
  "azure-debug-relay.hybrid-connection-string": "Endpoint=sb://your-relay.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=key_name;SharedAccessKey=REDACTED;EntityPath=test",

  "azure-debug-relay.hybrid-connection-name": "test",  
}
```

> Whenever Azure Debug Relay VS Code extension detects non-empty `azure-debug-relay.hybrid-connection-string` and `azure-debug-relay.hybrid-connection-name` settings (`vscode/settings.json`) or `AZRELAY_CONNECTION_STRING` and `AZRELAY_NAME` in `.azrelay.json` file, it launches Azure Relay Bridge every time a debugging session with debugpy in `listen` mode is about to begin. If extension settings are not empty and `.azrelay.json` is present, Azure Relay Bridge prefers values from the extension settings (`vscode/settings.json`).

Visual Studio Code extension ignores `AZRELAY_CONNECTION_STRING` and `AZRELAY_NAME` environment variables.

### Start debugging in Visual Studio Code

This step must be done on your dev machine in Visual Studio Code before launching the remote code.

1. Open `remote_server_demo.py` and put a breakpoint in `do_work()` function.
1. Makes sure your `.vscode/launch.json` has `Python: Listen 5678` configuration as in this repo's `.vscode/launch.json`.
1. Start debugging in your local Visual Studio Code in `Python: Listen 5678` configuration.

Notice how the debugger maps paths on the local and the remote machines.
If your code has a different structure remotely, you may need to provide more sophisticated path mappings. Here is that piece in `.vscode/launch.json`:

```json
"pathMappings": [
    {
        "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}",
        "remoteRoot": "."
    }
]
```

It tells VS Code that the workspace directory locally is mapped to the "current" directory remotely.

When the debugger looks goes through a file remotely, it needs to find the corresponding file in your local VS Code workspace.
When debugging `remote_server_demo.py`, the debugger maps `./samples/simple_demo/remote_server_demo.py` remotely to `${workspaceFolder}/samples/simple_demo/remote_server_demo.py` locally.

### Launch the example on the remote machine

1. Clone the repo.
1. Start `python3 ./samples/simple_demo/remote_server_demo.py --debug=attach`. Notice that current directory must contain `.azrelay.json` file unless configured with environment variables.

> Terminal session where you start #2 must have the repo's directory as current directory - for a reason of mapping local and remote directories.

If everything works as it's supposed to, you will hit a breakpoint in your local Visual Studio Code.

### Azure Machine Learning sample

Azure ML sample is located in `samples/azure_ml` directory.

It has 2 components:

1. `deploy.py` script that deploys and launches an Azure ML pipeline with a single step.
2. `steps/train.py` script which contains that simple step.

For Azure ML sample, configuration `Python: Listen for Azure ML` has different mappings:

```json
"pathMappings": [
    {
        "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}/samples/azure_ml/steps",
        "remoteRoot": "."
    }
]
```

This is because Azure ML deploys a container with files in `steps` directory
which will end up being current directory when running in on an Azure ML Compute target.

## Debugging multiple remote code instances

If you want to debug multiple instances of the same code running on different servers, each debugging session must use a different port.

Notice that this workspace has 2 "listen" configurations: "Python: Listen 567**8**" and "Python: Listen 567**9**", they use 2 different ports: 5678 and 5679. It also has a **compound** configuration **"Python: Two Listeners"** where both listeners start at the same time. Use this as an example of debugging multiple remote servers.

**Each server must be configured with a unique port number.**
You may want to store a collections of available port numbers in a persistent data structure
where you can "borrow" ports from using any distributed locking mechanism.

For example, on a Kubernetes cluster you can use
[etcd locks](https://python-etcd3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#etcd3.Lock).
Name those resources to lock after port numbers.

On Azure Machine Learning, you can leverage [Run.add_properties()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.run(class)?view=azure-ml-py#add-properties-properties-) function.
If property with a certain name (such as a port number) already exists,
add_properties() call with the same name will fail with an exception.

Another approach is to makes sure the debugging session only starts on one node. For example, on Azure Batch multi-instance tasks
`AZ_BATCH_IS_CURRENT_NODE_MASTER` environment variable equals `true` when running on the master node.

## Azure Debug Relay Python API

`remote_server_demo.py` shows how you can use Azure Debug Relay (azure-debug-relay package) with your code.

**azdebugrelay** module contains DebugRelay class that install and launches Azure Relay Bridge:

```python
from azdebugrelay import DebugRelay, DebugMode

access_key_or_connection_string = "AZURE RELAY HYBRID CONNECTION STRING OR ACCESS KEY"
relay_name = "RELAY NAME" # your Hybrid Connection name
debug_mode = DebugMode.Connect # or DebugMode.WaitForConnection if connecting from another end
hybrid_connection_url = "HYBRID CONNECTION URL" # can be None if access_key_or_connection_string is a connection string
host = "127.0.0.1" # local hostname or ip address the debugger starts on
port = 5678 # any available port that you can use within your machine

debug_relay = DebugRelay(access_key_or_connection_string, relay_name, debug_mode, hybrid_connection_url, host, port)
debug_relay.open()

# attach to a remote debugger (usually from remote server code) with debug_mode = DebugMode.Connect
debugpy.connect((host, port))

# Debug, debug, debug
# ...
# ...

debug_relay.close()
```

* `access_key_or_connection_string` - SAS Policy key or Connection String for Azure Relay Hybrid Connection. Must have `Send` and `Listen` permissions
* `relay_name` - name of the Hybrid Connection
* `debug_mode` - debug connection mode. `DebugMode.WaitForConnection` when starting in listening mode, `DebugMode.Connect` for attaching to a remote debugger.
* `hybrid_connection_url` - Hybrid Connection URL. Required when access_key_or_connection_string as an access key, otherwise is ignored and may be None.
* `host` - Local hostname or ip address the debugger starts on, `127.0.0.1` by default
* `port` - debugging port, `5678` by default

## Troubleshooting

Why using [Azure Relay Bridge](https://github.com/Azure/azure-relay-bridge) which is a .NET Core application that we have to install and use via `subprocess` calls?

Reasons:

1. Azure Relay has SDKs for .NET, Java, and Node. [No Python SDK or examples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-relay/issues/28#issuecomment-390778193).
1. Azure Relay Bridge does a lot of things we have to implement otherwise. It is a great tool that can help you connecting different networks for many purposes: for RDP, SSH and other protocols over TCP or UDP.

A [private fork](https://github.com/vladkol/azure-relay-bridge) we are currently using is only to provide .NET Core 3.1 builds of the most recent code. There is a pending pul-requests: [one](https://github.com/Azure/azure-relay-bridge/pull/22) and [two](https://github.com/Azure/azure-relay-bridge/pull/19).

### Known issues

> **On macOS, there may be a situation when Azure Relay Bridge (`azbridge`) cannot connect when creating a local forwarder** (`-L` option).

**Reason**: .NET Core wants you to add your Computer Name to `/etc/hosts` file, and make sure the hostname is configured.

**Workaround**: Make necessary edits of `/etc/hosts` file, and configure hostname:

1. Look for your computer's name in `Settings â†’ Sharing`.
1. Run the following command: `scutil --set HostName "your-computer-name"`. (**replace `your-computer-name` with your computer's name**)
1. Open `/etc/hosts` in a text editor in *sudo* mode (VS Code can save it later in *sudo* mode).
1. Add the following line (**replace `your-computer-name` with your computer's name**). Save the file.

```text
127.0.0.1   your-computer-name
```

> **I launched the debugger as described and nothing happened**

**Reason**: you *probably* didn't put a breakpoint in your VS Code locally. Make sure that breakpoint is in a place that your server process actually runs through.

> **I do everything right, but nothing works**

**Reason**: Stop all debugging sessions (if any). Kill all `azbridge` processes. Try again.
