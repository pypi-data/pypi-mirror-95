1.1.0: 2018-04-09
-----------------

This is a small release with some enhancements.

Features Added
``````````````

- Repository collaborators now returns a ``users.Collaborator`` object, instead
  of a ``users.ShortUser`` object. This is to support collaborator
  affiliations. A refresh call of this object (and ``users.Contributor``) will
  result in a full ``users.User`` object.

- The call to iterate collaborators of a repository
  (``Repository#collaborators``) can now take an ``affiliation`` filter with
  options of ``outside``, ``direct``, and ``all``. The default is ``all``,
  which preserves the previous behavior of this method.

Bugs Fixed
``````````

- Parse certain attributes on ``IssueEvent`` into objects (again, this was a
  regression in 1.0)

- Handle older GitHub Enterprise responses for authenticated user objects

- Handle large file pull request responses not including a ``patch`` attribute
