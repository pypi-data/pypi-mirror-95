class ParallelLab(Lab):
    '''A :class:`Lab` that uses local parallelism.

    Unlike a basic :class:`Lab`, this class runs multiple experiments
    in parallel to accelerate throughput. Unlike a :class:`ClusterLab` it
    runs all jobs synchronously and locally, and so can't make use of a larger
    compute cluster infrastructure and can't run tasks in the background
    to be collected later. This does however mean that ``epyc`` can make
    full use of a multicore machine quite trivially.

    The optional ``cores`` parameter selects the number of cores to use:

    - a value of 1 uses 1 core (sequential mode);
    - a value of +n uses n cores;
    - a value of 0 uses all available cores; and
    - a value of -n uses (available - n) cores.

    So a value of ``cores=-1`` will run on 1 fewer cores than the total number
    of physical cores available on the machine.
    
    .. important ::

        This behaviour is slightly different to that of ``joblib``
        as described `here <https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/joblib.Parallel.html>`_.

    Note that you can specify more cores to use
    than there are physical cores on the machine: this will have no positive effects.
    Note also that using all the cores on a machine may result in you being
    locked out of the user interface as your experiments consume all available
    computational resources, and may also be regarded as an unfriendly act by
    any other users with whom you share the machine.
