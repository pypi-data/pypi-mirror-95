S-Centrality Measures
=====================
We generalize graph metrics to s-metrics for a hypergraph by using its s-connected
components. This is accomplished by computing the s edge-adjacency matrix and
constructing the corresponding graph of the matrix. We then use existing graph metrics
on this representation of the hypergraph. In essence we construct an *s*-line graph
corresponding to the hypergraph on which to apply our methods.

S-Metrics for hypergraphs are discussed in depth in:

def s_betweenness_centrality(H, s=1, normalized=True):
    '''
    A centrality measure for an s-edge subgraph of H based on shortest paths.
    The betweenness centrality of an s-edge e is the sum of the fraction of all
    shortest s-paths between s-edges that pass through e.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    H : Hypergraph
    s : int
        minimum size of edges to be considered
    normalized : bool, default=False,
        If true the betweenness values are normalized by `2/((n-1)(n-2))`,
        where n is the number of edges in H

    Returns:
    --------
     : dict
        A dictionary of s-betweenness centrality value of the edges.

def s_harmonic_closeness_centrality(H, edge=None, s=1):
    '''
    A centrality measure for an s-edge subgraph of H. A value equal to 1 means the s-edge
    intersects every other s-edge in H. All values range between 0 and 1.
    Edges of size less than s return 0. If H contains only one s-edge a 0 is returned.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    H : Hypergraph
    edge : str or Entity, optional
        an edge or uid of an edge in H
        If None then a dictionary of values for all s-edges is returned.
    s : int
        minimum size of edges to be considered

    Returns:
    --------
     : dict or float
        returns the s-harmonic closeness centrality value of the edges, a number between 0 and 1 inclusive.
        If edge=None a dictionary of values for each s-edge in H is returned.
        If edge then a single value is returned.
