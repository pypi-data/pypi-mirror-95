======

Packaging refresh and associated cleanups, including fix

v3.1.0
======

``classproperty`` decorator now supplies a
``classproperty.Meta`` class. Classes that wish to have
a class property should derive from that metaclass. This
approach solves the unintended behavior of the property
only being set on a given instance. For compatibility, the
old behavior is retained if the metaclass is not used.

Project now requires Python 3.6 or later.
