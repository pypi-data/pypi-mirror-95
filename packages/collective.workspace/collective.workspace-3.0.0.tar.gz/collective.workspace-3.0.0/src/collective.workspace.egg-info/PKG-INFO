        collective.workspace
        ====================
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        collective.workspace package for providing 'membership' in specific areas of a Plone Site.
        
        It allows you to grant people access to areas of content using a membership group rather than local roles for each user, and to delegate control over that group to people who don't have access to the site-wide user/group control panel.
        
        collective.workspace provides a ``collective.workspace.team_workspace`` behavior that can be enabled for any Dexterity content type. When enabled, it adds a "Roster" tab which is where you can manage the team.
        
        All the functionality takes place via an IWorkspace adapter, which can be overridden to specify:
        
        * A list of groups, and the roles that each group should receive. These groups are created automatically via a PAS plugin, and automatically granted local roles using a borg.localrole adapter.
        * The schema for which fields should be stored for each member in the roster. This includes checkboxes for the groups, to determine which groups the member is in.
        * Action links for each row in the roster. The default is an "Edit" link which brings up a popup to edit the fields for that person's roster membership.
        * Action buttons at the bottom of the roster which apply to the rows the user selects. An example of this could be a 'Send email' action, so a roster admin can easily email users in the roster.
        
        Unlike similar previous packages (see slc.teamfolder and collective.local.*), collective.workspace supplies its own PAS groups plugin, instead of using standard Plone groups. This means that you can prevent Workspace-specific groups from appearing in the sitewide group control panel.
        
        Some other features are:
        
        * Membership in a roster is indexed, so you can search the catalog for items of portal_type X that have a particular user in their roster.
        * Events are fired when roster memberships are added/modified/removed.
        
        Basic Installation
        ------------------
        
        * Add collective.workspace to your buildout eggs.
        * Install collective.workspace in the 'Add-ons' section of Plone's Site Setup.
        * Enable the behaviour on your dexterity content type (Either using GenericSetup or Site Setup -> Dexterity Content Types).
        
        Compatibility
        -------------
        
        For Plone 5.1 and 5.2 you should use version 3.x.
        For Plone 4.3 and 5.0 you should use version 2.x.
        
        Custom Workspace Groups
        -----------------------
        
        The default groups available on a workspace are 'Guests', 'Members', and 'Admins'.
        You can customise the groups that are available editing the registry record ``collective.workspace.available_groups``.

        ------------------
        
        Bugs fixed:
        
        - Fixes the automatic groups calculation in some cases.
          The bug was preventing the users from being added to the ``Members``
          group in some cases, e.g. during the upgrade step from version 1.x
          (Fixes #27)
        
        
        2.0b2 (2018-04-10)
        ------------------
        
        Bugs fixed:
        
        - an edge case where the migration was failing (Fixes #25)
        
        
        2.0b1 (2018-03-16)
        ------------------
        
        Changed functionality:
        
        - The `workspace_groups` PAS plugin now stores groups in the same way as normal Plone groups,
          rather than doing catalog queries to find workspaces.
          This performs much better even without enabling caching for the plugin.
          These workspace-based groups are updated automatically as workspace rosters are edited.
          (A separate plugin is used so that listing of workspace groups in the Plone control panel
          can easily be disabled.)
        - The Members group is no longer displayed as an option in the UI,
          since it is assigned automatically. Other automatic workspace groups can be
          configured with arbitrary conditions for inclusion in the group.
        - Copying and pasting a workspace now empties the roster of the copy.
        - Trying to set a membership attribute directly now raises an exception.
          Membership attributes should be updated using the `update` method
          to make sure that all changes are properly accounted for.
        - A last modified time is now tracked for each roster membership.
        - It's now possible to add a roster entry that isn't associated with a user
          (for example, to represent a person who doesn't have a Plone account).
        
        Bugs fixed:
        
        - A change to the `user` of a workspace membership is now handled properly
          (which might need to happen, for example, when merging users).
        - Membership fields can now have a `defaultFactory` that is context-aware
          (the field is now bound to the membershp before fetching the default).
        - When a user is deleted from the site,
          their memberships in any workspaces are now also deleted.
        - New workspace counters can now be added without breaking existing workspaces.
        - Tools are now looked up using `plone.api.portal.get_tool`,
          which helps in some cases where objects are not properly acquisition-wrapped.
        - Make sure UID doesn't get reset when calling add_to_team
          with a user who is already in the workspace.
        
        Cleanup:
        
        - Removed code related to caching (`purge_workspace_pas_cache`) that is no longer used.

        - Performance improvements
        - Intelligent caching of groups, plus cache invalidation on changes to a workspace
        - Added a new role TeamGuest that can be used to grant reduced access
          permissions to a workspace
