OpenStack Placement
===================

OpenStack Placement provides an HTTP service for managing, selecting,
and claiming providers of classes of inventory representing available
resources in a cloud.

API

To learn how to use Placement's API, consult the documentation available
online at:

- `Placement API Reference <https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/placement/>`__

For more information on OpenStack APIs, SDKs and CLIs in general, refer to:

- `OpenStack for App Developers <https://www.openstack.org/appdev/>`__
- `Development resources for OpenStack clouds
  <https://developer.openstack.org/>`__

Operators
---------

To learn how to deploy and configure OpenStack Placement, consult the
documentation available online at:

- `OpenStack Placement <https://docs.openstack.org/placement/>`__

In the unfortunate event that bugs are discovered, they should be reported to
the appropriate bug tracker. If you obtained the software from a 3rd party
operating system vendor, it is often wise to use their own bug tracker for
reporting problems. In all other cases use the master OpenStack bug tracker,
available at:

- `Bug Tracker <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/project/openstack/placement>`__
