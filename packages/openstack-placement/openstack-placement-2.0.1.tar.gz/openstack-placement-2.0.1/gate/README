This directory contains files used by the OpenStack infra test system. They are
really only relevant within the scope of the OpenStack infra system and are not
expected to be useful to anyone else.

These files are a mixture of:

* Hooks and other scripts to be used by the OpenStack infra test system. These
  scripts may be called by certain jobs at important times to do extra testing,
  setup, run services, etc.

* "gabbits" are test files to be used with some of the jobs described in
  .zuul.yaml and playbooks. When changes are made in the gabbits or playbooks
  it is quite likely that queries in the playbooks or the assertions in the
  gabbits will need to be updated.
