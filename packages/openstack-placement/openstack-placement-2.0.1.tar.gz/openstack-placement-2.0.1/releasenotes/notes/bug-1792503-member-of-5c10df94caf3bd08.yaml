    Previously, when an aggregate was specified by the ``member_of``
    query parameter in the ``GET /allocation_candidates`` operation,
    the non-root providers in the aggregate were excluded unless their
    root provider was also in the aggregate. With this release, the
    non-root providers directly associated with the aggregate are also
    considered. See the `Bug#1792503`_ for details.
