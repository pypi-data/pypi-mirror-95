    In microversion 1.33, the syntax for granular groupings of resource,
    required/forbidden trait, and aggregate association requests introduced in
    `1.25`_ has been extended to allow, in addition to numbers, strings from 1
    to 64 characters in length consisting of a-z, A-Z, 0-9, ``_``, and ``-``.
    This is done to allow naming conventions (e.g., ``resources_COMPUTE`` and
    ``resources_NETWORK``) to emerge in situations where multiple services are
    collaborating to make requests.
