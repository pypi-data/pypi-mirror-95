    In microversion 1.34_ the body of the response to a
    ``GET /allocation_candidates`` request_ has been extended to include a
    ``mappings`` field with each allocation request. The value is a dictionary
    associating request group suffixes with the uuids of those resource
    providers that satisfy the identified request group. For convenience, this
    mapping can be included in the request payload for ``POST /allocations``,
    ``PUT /allocations/{consumer_uuid}``, and ``POST /reshaper``, but it will
    be ignored.
