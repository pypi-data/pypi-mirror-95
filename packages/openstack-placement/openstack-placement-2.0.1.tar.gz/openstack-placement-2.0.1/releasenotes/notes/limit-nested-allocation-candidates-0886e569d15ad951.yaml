    Limiting nested resource providers with the ``limit=N`` query parameter
    when calling ``GET /allocation_candidates`` could result in incomplete
    provider summaries. This is now fixed so that all resource providers that
    are in the same trees as any provider mentioned in the limited allocation
    requests are shown in the provider summaries collection. For more
    information see `story/2005859`_.
