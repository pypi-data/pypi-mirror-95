    A configuration setting ``[placement_database]/sync_on_startup`` is added
    which, if set to ``True``, will cause database schema migrations to be
    called when the placement web application is started. This avoids the need
    to call ``placement-manage db sync`` separately.

    To preserve backwards compatibility and avoid unexpected changes, the
    default of the setting is ``False``.
