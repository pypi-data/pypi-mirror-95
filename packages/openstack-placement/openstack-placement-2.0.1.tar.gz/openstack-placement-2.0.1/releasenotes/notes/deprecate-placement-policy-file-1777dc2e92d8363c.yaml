deprecations:
  - |
    The ``[placement]/policy_file`` configuration option is deprecated and its
    usage is being replaced with the more standard
    ``[oslo_policy]/policy_file`` option. If you do not override policy with
    custom rules you will have nothing to do. If you do override the placement
    default policy then you will need to update your configuration to use the
    ``[oslo_policy]/policy_file`` option. By default, the
    ``[oslo_policy]/policy_file`` option will be used if the file it points at
    exists.
