    The ``Missing Root Provider IDs`` upgrade check in the
    ``placement-status upgrade check`` command will now produce a failure
    if it detects any ``resource_providers`` records with a null
    ``root_provider_id`` value. Run the
    ``placement-manage db online_data_migrations`` command to heal these
    types of records.
