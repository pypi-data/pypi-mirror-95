    From microversion ``1.36``, a new ``same_subtree`` queryparam on
    ``GET /allocation_candidates`` is supported. It accepts a comma-separated
    list of request group suffix strings ($S). Each must exactly match a suffix
    on a granular group somewhere else in the request. Importantly, the
    identified request groups need not have a resources$S. If this is provided,
    at least one of the resource providers satisfying a specified request
    group must be an ancestor of the rest. The ``same_subtree`` query parameter
    can be repeated and each repeated group is treated independently.
