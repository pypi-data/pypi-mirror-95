    The 2.0.0 release of placement is the first release where placement is
    available solely from its own project and must be installed separately from
    nova. If the extracted placement is not already in use, prior to upgrading
    to Train, the Stein version of placement must be installed. See
    `Upgrading from Nova to Placement`_ for details.

    2.0.0 adds a suite of features which, combined, enable targeting candidate
    providers that have complex trees modeling NUMA layouts, multiple devices,
    and networks where affinity between and grouping among the members of the
    tree are required. These features will help to enable NFV and other high
    performance workloads in the cloud.

    Also added is support for forbidden aggregates which allows groups of
    resource providers to only be used for specific purposes, such as reserving
    a group of compute nodes for licensed workloads.

    Extensive benchmarking and profiling have led to massive performance
    enhancements, especially in environments with large numbers of resource
    providers and high concurrency.
