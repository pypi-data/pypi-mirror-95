    The 1.0.0 release of Placement is the first release where the Placement
    code is hosted in its own repository_ and managed as its own OpenStack
    project. Because of this, the majority of changes are not user-facing.
    There are a small number of new features (including microversion 1.31_)
    and bug fixes, listed below.

    A new document, `Upgrading from Nova to Placement`_, has been created. It
    explains the steps required to upgrade to extracted Placement from Nova and
    to migrate data from the ``nova_api`` database to the
    ``placement_database``.
