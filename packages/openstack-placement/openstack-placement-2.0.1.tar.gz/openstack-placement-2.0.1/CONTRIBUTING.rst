If you would like to contribute to the development of the Placement service and
have never developed for an offical OpenStack project before, you must follow
the steps in this page to perform required setup:

    https://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html

Once those steps have been completed, changes to OpenStack may be submitted for
review via the Gerrit tool, following the workflow documented at:

    https://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html#development-workflow

There is a growing suite of documentation for Placement contributors published
at:

    https://docs.openstack.org/placement/latest/contributor/index.html

Note that OpenStack does not use GitHub. Pull requests and issues submitted
there will not be seen.

Bugs should be filed on StoryBoard:
