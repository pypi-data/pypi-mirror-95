    Runs Difference Causal Inference (DCI) algorithm with stability selection to estimate the difference-DAG between two settings.

    sample_fraction: float, default = 0.7
        The fraction of samples to be used in each bootstrap sample.
        Should be between 0 and 1. If 1, all samples are used.
    n_bootstrap_iterations: int, default = 50
        Number of bootstrap samples to create.
    bootstrap_threshold: float, default = 0.5
        Threshold defining the minimum cutoff value for the stability scores. Edges with stability scores above

        Seed used by the random number generator.
