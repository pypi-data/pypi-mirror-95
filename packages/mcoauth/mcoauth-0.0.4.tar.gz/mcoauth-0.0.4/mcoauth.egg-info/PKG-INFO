Description: # MCOauth
        This is a simple package to use MCOauth. Initialize a Minecraft Player
        ``` 
        MinecraftPlayer(token)
        ```
        Most things are async except for initializing MinecraftPlayer which is not a blocking call because it uses
        ```
        asyncio.run
        ```
        A MinecraftPlayer has two properties, uuid and username.
        Using
        ```
        int(MinecraftPlayer(token))
        ```
        will return token.
        Note that tokens are only valid for 5 minutes, see https://mc-oauth.net/
