# humpday

A package that helps you choose a Python global optimizer package, and strategy therin, from [Ax-Platform](https://github.com/microprediction/humpday/blob/main/humpday/optimizers/axcube.py), [bayesian-optimization](https://github.com/microprediction/humpday/blob/main/humpday/optimizers/bayesoptcube.py), [DLib](https://github.com/microprediction/humpday/blob/main/humpday/optimizers/dlibcube.py), [HyperOpt](https://github.com/microprediction/humpday/blob/main/humpday/optimizers/hyperoptcube.py), [NeverGrad](https://github.com/microprediction/humpday/blob/main/humpday/optimizers/nevergradcube.py), [Optuna](https://github.com/microprediction/humpday/blob/main/humpday/optimizers/optunacube.py), [Platypus](https://github.com/microprediction/humpday/blob/main/humpday/optimizers/platypuscube.py), [PyMoo](https://github.com/microprediction/humpday/blob/main/humpday/optimizers/pymoocube.py), [PySOT](https://github.com/microprediction/humpday/blob/main/humpday/optimizers/pysotcube.py), Scipy [classic](https://github.com/microprediction/humpday/blob/main/humpday/optimizers/scipycube.py) and [shgo](https://github.com/microprediction/humpday/blob/main/humpday/optimizers/shgocube.py), [Skopt](https://github.com/microprediction/humpday/blob/main/humpday/optimizers/skoptcube.py), and [UltraOpt](https://github.com/microprediction/humpday/blob/main/humpday/optimizers/ultraoptcube.py). 

### 

- 50+ strategies are assigned [Elo ratings](https://github.com/microprediction/optimizer-elo-ratings/tree/main/results/leaderboards/overall).
- All are presented in a common calling syntax. By all means contribute more to [optimizers](https://github.com/microprediction/humpday/tree/main/humpday/optimizers). 
- Pass the dimensions of the problem, function evaluation budget and time budget to receive [suggestions](https://github.com/microprediction/humpday/blob/main/humpday/comparison/suggestions.py),
- Or call the [meta](https://github.com/microprediction/humpday/blob/main/humpday/optimizers/meta.py) minimizer, which will choose one and run it.   

        from humpday import minimize
        best_val, best_x = minimize(f, n_dim=13, n_trials=130 )

Here *f* is intended to be minimized on the hypercube [0,1]^n_dim.

### Optimizer suggestions

        from pprint import pprint 
        from humpday import suggest
        pprint(suggest(n_dim=5, n_trials=130,n_seconds=5*60))

where *n_seconds* is the total computation budget for the optimizer (not the objective function) over all 130 function evaluations. Alternatively you can pass
an objective function:

        from humpday import recommend

        def my_objective(u):
            time.sleep(0.01)
            return u[0]*math.sin(u[1])

        recommendations = recommend(my_objective, n_dim=21, n_trials=130)

As this function is very fast, some optimizers will be culled from the list.   

### Install

    pip install humpday

Bleeding edge:

    pip install git+https://github.com/microprediction/humpday

File an issue if you have problems. If you get a CMake error, try:

    pip install cmake
    pip install humpday 

#### Optional packages

I removed ultraopt from setup so you'll have to install it manually:

    pip install cmake
    pip install ultraopt
