# Halo Bian - Flask BIAN Python Reference Architecture Library

The **Halo Bian** library is based on the [**Halo**](https://github.com/halo-framework/halo-app) library which is a python based library utilizing [**Serverless**](https://logz.io/blog/serverless-vs-containers/) technology and [**microservices architecture**](http://blog.binaris.com/your-guide-to-migrating-existing-microservices-to-serverless/) 


BIAN (Banking Industry Architecture Network) is a membership group committed to developing open standards around banking and financial services.  A key deliverable of this group is the BIAN Service Landscape model which defines a comprehensive services architecture for financial transactions and facilities.  This library is an implementation of the BIAN model leveraging the Flask framework and allows a developer to **rapidly create BIAN-compliant services** while hiding much of the underlying BIAN model details.  See www.bian.org for more information on BIAN.

This library leverages not only the Flask framework, but a number of the Flask Cloud Services components as well to facilitate building robust and resilient cloud-native BIAN microservices. 
deploy your Service Domain to your local environment or use [**Serverless Framework**](https://serverless.com/) and [**zappa**](https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa) to deploy your Service Domain to AWS.

## BIAN Basics

Before diving into the library architecture, it helps to understand two key concepts within BIAN, service domains and control records.

### Service Domain

The BIAN Service Landscape defines discrete areas of responsibility known as service domains.  A **Service Domain** is a combination of a **Functional Pattern** and an **Asset Type**.  For instance, using the functional pattern 'Registry' with the asset type 'Product' would yield a 'Product Registry' service domain, which could be used to manage a product catalog.  If we instead changed the asset type to 'Device', we would have a 'Device Registry' service domain that could be used to authorize services on a mobile device.  

### Control Record

The **Control Record** is used to track the state of a service domain, and like the service domain is derived from the functional pattern and asset type.  However, in a control record, the functional pattern is represented by the **Generic Artifact Type**.  There is a one-to-one correlation between functional patterns and generic artifact types.  The control record goes one step further in delineating between specific service domain operations by introducing an additional parameter called the **Behavior Qualifier**, which, like generic artifact types, have a one-to-one correlation with functional patterns.

### In Addition

-  The commercial behaviors that are called Functional Patterns. Functional Patterns, Generic Artifacts and Behavior Qualifier Types are mapped and correlated:

-  A Service Domain applies one of the 18 functional patterns to instances of one type of asset:

-  The standard set of ‘action terms’ that characterize the range of service operation calls :

-  The Default Action Term By Functional Pattern matrix:

### BIAN Summary

So to summarize the above:

**Functional Pattern** ==> **Generic Artifact Type** ==> **Behavior Qualifier**

**Functional Pattern** + **Asset Type** = **Service Domain**

**Generic Artifact Type** + **Asset Type** + (optional)**Behavior Qualifier** = **Control Record**

**Functional Pattern** is correlated with a set of **Action Term** = **Service Domain Operations**

Key Benefits of using BIAN API solutions:

-  Support for Emerging Industry Approaches – Two key technology approaches are considered: API development and the adoption of a Micro-service architecture
-  Support for Industry Standards – The BIAN Service Domains and service operations present an Industry standard definition for the componentization and service enablement of Banking
-  Support for Incremental Adoption/Migration – BIAN aligned solutions can be implemented and adopted incrementally enabling a prioritized migration from constraining legacy architectures

## Architecture

The Flask BIAN library implements a BIAN service domain wrapper that acts as an API and data translator while hiding much of the BIAN model complexity from the developer.

If you are building a Python web app running on AWS Lambda (Flask), use this library to manage api transactions:

```
            sagax = load_saga("test", jsonx, schema)
            payloads = {"BookHotel": {"abc": "def"}, "BookFlight": {"abc": "def"}, "BookRental": {"abc": "def"},
                        "CancelHotel": {"abc": "def"}, "CancelFlight": {"abc": "def"}, "CancelRental": {"abc": "def"}}
            apis = {"BookHotel": self.create_api1, "BookFlight": self.create_api2, "BookRental": self.create_api3,
                    "CancelHotel": self.create_api4, "CancelFlight": self.create_api5, "CancelRental": self.create_api6}
            try:
                self.context = Util.get_lambda_context(request)
                ret = sagax.execute(self.req_context, payloads, apis)
                return {"saga": "good"}, 200
            except SagaRollBack as e:
                return {"saga": "bad"}, 500
```
