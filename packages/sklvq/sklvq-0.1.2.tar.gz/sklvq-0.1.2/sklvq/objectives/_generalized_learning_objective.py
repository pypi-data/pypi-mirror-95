    Parameters
    ----------
    activation_type : {"identity", "sigmoid", "soft-plus", "swish"} or type

        require any parameters.
    discriminant_type: {"relative-distance"} or type
        Can only be the relative distance. If not a string it can be a custom class.
        See :class:`sklvq.discriminants.DiscriminantBaseClass`.
