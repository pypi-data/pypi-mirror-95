GtkMe is a wrapper library for python gtk programs, it provides many of the
functionalities of Gtk with many of the nasty API surprises taken out.

Developed originally to formalise the threading of gtk windows for complex
interaction with plugins, over some years it's taken on a life as a repository
of ideas and patterns for dealing with Gtk's complexity.
