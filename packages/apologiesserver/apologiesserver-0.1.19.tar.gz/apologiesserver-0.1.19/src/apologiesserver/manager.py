"""
State manager.

Python's asyncio is primarily meant for use in single-threaded code, but there is still
concurrent execution happening any time we hit a yield from or await.

We want to minimize the risk of unexpected behavior when there are conflicting requests.
For instance, if we simultaneously get a request to start a game and to quit a game, we
want to make sure that one operation completes entirely before the next one starts.  This
means that we need thread synchronization whenever state is updated.

I've chosen to synchronize all state upate operations behind a single transaction boundary
(a single lock).  This is easier to follow and easier to write (correctly) than tracking
individual locks at a more granular level, like at the player or the game level.  The
state will never be locked for all that long, because state update operations are all done
in-memory and are quite fast.  The slow stuff like network requests all happen outside the
lock, whether we're processing a request or executing a scheduled task.

The design would be different if we were using a database to save state, but this seems
like the best compromise for the simple in-memory design that we're using now.

The transaction boundary is handled by a single lock on the StateManager object.  Callers
must ensure that they get that lock before reading or modifying state in any way.  Other 
than that, none of the objects defined in this module are thread-safe, or even thread-aware.  
There are no asynchronous methods or await calls.  This simplifies the implementation and 
avoids confusion.
