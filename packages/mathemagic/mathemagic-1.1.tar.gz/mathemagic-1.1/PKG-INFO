        A Module containing a lot of general and commonly used mathematical functions written in Python.
        
        Key Features
        -------------
        
        - Commonly used and required mathematics operation in your finger tips.
        - Many new functions are being added regularly.
        - Proper error handling.
        - Easy to use.
        - Optimised in both speed and memory.
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        **Python 3.x is recommended, but you can also install it on python2.x**

        .. code:: sh
        
            # Linux/macOS (Replace python3 with python to install for python2.x)
            python3 -m pip install -U mathematics
        
            # Windows
            pip install -U mathematics
        
        
        To install the development version, do the following:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            $ git clone https://github.com/FireHead90544/mathemagic
            $ cd mathemagic
            $ python3 -m pip install -U .
        
        
        Quick Example
        --------------
        
        .. code:: py
        
            import mathemagic
        
            mathemagic.pi(4) # Returns 3.1415, the value of pi till 4 digits after decimal.
        
            mathemagic.even(140) # Returns True, as 140 is an even number.
        
            mathemagic.calculate("100 + 200 - 150") # Returns 150, tries calculating the expression given.
        
            mathemagic.factorial(5) # Returns 120 as 5! = 120, returns the factorial of a given number.
        
            mathemagic.prime(20) # Returns False, as 20 is not a prime number, returns True/False based upon the number is prime or not.
        
        
        You can find more examples in the documentation.
