# PanACOTA is a software providing tools for large scale bacterial comparative  #
# genomics. From a set of complete and/or draft genomes, you can:               #
#    -  Do a quality control of your strains, to eliminate poor quality         #
# genomes, which would not give any information for the comparative study       #
#    -  Uniformly annotate all genomes                                          #
#    -  Do a Pan-genome                                                         #
#    -  Do a Core or Persistent genome                                          #
#    -  Align all Core/Persistent families                                      #
#    -  Infer a phylogenetic tree from the Core/Persistent families             #
#                                                                               #
