# PanACOTA is a software providing tools for large scale bacterial comparative  #
# genomics. From a set of complete and/or draft genomes, you can:               #
#    -  Do a quality control of your strains, to eliminate poor quality         #
# genomes, which would not give any information for the comparative study       #
#    -  Uniformly annotate all genomes                                          #
#    -  Do a Pan-genome                                                         #
#    -  Do a Core or Persistent genome                                          #
#    -  Align all Core/Persistent families                                      #
#    -  Infer a phylogenetic tree from the Core/Persistent families             #

    Build a file containing all proteins of all genomes contained in lstinfo.

    ----------
    lstinfo : str
        1 line per genome, only 1st column considered here, as the genome name
        without extension
    dbpath : str
        Proteins folder, containing all proteins for each genome. Each genome has
        its own protein file, called `<genome_name>.prt`.

    spedir : str or None
        By default, output file is saved in dbpath directory. If it must be saved somewhere
