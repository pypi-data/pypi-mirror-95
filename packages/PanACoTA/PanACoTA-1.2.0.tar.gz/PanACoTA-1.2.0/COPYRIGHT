PanACoTA  (PANgenome with Annotations, COre identification, Tree and corresponding Alignments) is a software providing tools for large scale bacterial comparative genomics. You can download all refseq genomes for a given species, or use your set of complete and/or draft genomes, to:

- Do a quality control of your strains, to eliminate poor quality genomes, which would not give any information for the comparative study
- Uniformly annotate all genomes (with functional annotation, or only syntactic annotation, according to your needs)
- Do a Pan-genome
- Do a Core or Persistent genome
- Align all Core/Persistent families
- Infer a phylogenetic tree from the Core/Persistent families
