MinTOTP
=======

MinTOTP is a minimal TOTP generator written in Python.


Introduction
------------

TOTP stands for Time-Based One-Time Password. Many websites and services
require two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication
(MFA) where the user is required to present two or more pieces of
evidence:

  - Something only the user knows, e.g., password, passphrase, etc.
  - Something only the user has, e.g., hardware token, mobile phone, etc.
  - Something only the user is, e.g., biometrics.

A TOTP value serves as the second factor, i.e., it proves that the user
is in possession of a device (e.g., mobile phone) that contains a TOTP
secret key from which the TOTP value is generated. Usually the service
provider that provides a user's account also issues a secret key encoded
either as a Base32 string or as a QR code. This secret key is added to
an authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator) on a mobile device.
The app can then generate TOTP values based on the current time.
By default, it generates a new TOTP value every 30 seconds.

MinTOTP is a Python tool that can be used to generate TOTP values from a
secret key. Additionally, it exposes its functionality as module-level
functions for Python developers. It can be used on any system with
Python 3.4 or later installed on it.
