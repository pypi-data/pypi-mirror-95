        ========================
        
        If you need to migrate rer.bandi -> redturtle.bandi, follow these instructions:
        
        - Copy bandi settings somewhere

        - Uninstall rer.bandi
        - Install redturtle.bandi
        - Fill Bandi control panel with old settings

        Different layouts
        -----------------
        There are two allowed views for an announcement:
        
        * default view, with basic infos on the right (like events) and extra infos (folder deepenings) in the middle.
        * alternative view that moves extra infos slot below basic infos.
        
        Folder deepening
        ----------------
        Like in **rer.structured_content**, it has a special folder type called "*Folder Deepening*" that allows to manage some extra infos or attachment that should be shown in the announcement's view.

        Announcement state information
        ------------------------------
        In the search results and in the two new topic views, there are also some infos about the announcement, like his state (open, closed or in progress).

        ---------------------
