Description: **Dimensigon (DM)** is our backend technology at store.dimensigon.com to bootstrap ELASTIC Services.
        
        As main features:
        
        - Polyglot or Heterogeneous orquestrations
        - Mesh Networking
        - Decentralization of IoT or IoT 2.0 as we understand it for our own implementation.
        - Distributed-Decentralized Server Management, High-complex orchestrations
        - Full RESTful and easily embeddable
        - Distributed Vault for Configuration Management or Secrets
        - Log Federation
        - Double Encryption (SSL + Encrypted messaging by default)
        - ACLs for higher granularity and security control on top of OS Security.
        
        
        All these functionality makes **Dimensigon (DM)** a good standard for companies serving as Coordination layer for all automation technologies (Polyglot).
        **Dimensigon** (DM) lowers the costs of administration and simplify the management of high-complex environments like Hybrid Multi-Cloud.
         
        
        **Dimensigon (DM)** is a 100% Python and REAL Open Source project.
        
        **REAL Open Source** => No Freemium or Enterprise versions would be available in the future
