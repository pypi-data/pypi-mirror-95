        ``scrapy-poet`` is the `web-poet`_ Page Object pattern implementation for Scrapy.
        ``scrapy-poet`` allows to write spiders where extraction logic is separated from the crawling one.
        With ``scrapy-poet`` is possible to make a single spider that supports many sites with
        different layouts.
