## Introduction

OpenPD, standing for **Open** **P**eptide **D**ynamics, is a python package, distributed freely under the terms of
**MIT** License, for peptide dynamics simulation. It was designed to simulate the folding dynamics of protein efficiently with the assistance of **P**eptide **D**ynamics **F**orce **F**ield (PDFF), which is a solvent considered, high-level coarse-grained force field focusing on the peptide interaction. 

OpenPD is developed and maintained by Zhenyu Wei (zhenyuwei99@gmail.com), from Yunfei Chen's group in Southeast University. As a newly developed program, we always welcome developers to contact us.

The OpenPD distribution includes following files and folders:
