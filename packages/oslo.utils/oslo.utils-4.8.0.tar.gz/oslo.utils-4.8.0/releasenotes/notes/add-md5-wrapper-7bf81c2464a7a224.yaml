    A wrapper for hashlib.md5() has been added to allow OpenStack to run on
    systems where FIPS is enabled.  Under FIPS, md5 is disabled and calls to
    hashlib.md5() will fail.  In most cases in OpenStack, though, md5 is not
    used within a security context.

    In https://bugs.python.org/issue9216, a proposal has been made to allow
    the addition of a keyword parameter usedforsecurity, which can be used to
    designate non-security context uses.  In this case, md5() operations would
    be permitted.  This feature is expected to be delivered in python 3.9.

    Downstream python already supports this option, though.  This wrapper
    simply allows for this option to be supported where the underlying python
    version supports it.
