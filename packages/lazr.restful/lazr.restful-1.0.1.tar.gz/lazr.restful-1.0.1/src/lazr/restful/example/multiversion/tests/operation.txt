Named operations
****************

Named operations have some special features that are too obscure to
mention in the introductory doctest.

total_size versus total_size_link
---------------------------------

In old versions of lazr.restful, named operations that return
collections always send a 'total_size' containing the total size of a
collection.

    >>> from lazr.restful.testing.webservice import (
    ...     pprint_collection,
    ...     WebServiceCaller,
    ...     )
    >>> webservice = WebServiceCaller(domain='multiversion.dev')

In the example web service, named operations always send 'total_size'
up to version '2.0'.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from lazr.restful.interfaces import IWebServiceConfiguration
    >>> config = getUtility(IWebServiceConfiguration)
    >>> print(config.first_version_with_total_size_link)
    2.0

When the 'byValue' operation is invoked in version 1.0, it always returns a
total_size.

    >>> def get_collection(version, op='byValue', value="bar", size=2):
    ...     url = '/pairs?ws.op=%s&value=%s&ws.size=%s' % (op, value, size)
    ...     return webservice.get(url, api_version=version).jsonBody()

    >>> for key in sorted(get_collection('1.0')):
    ...     print(key)
    entries
    next_collection_link
    start
    total_size

The operation itself doesn't change between 1.0 and 2.0, but in
version 2.0, the operation starts returning total_size_link.

    >>> for key in sorted(get_collection('2.0')):
    ...     print(key)
    entries
    next_collection_link
    start
    total_size_link

The same happens in 3.0.

    >>> for key in sorted(get_collection('3.0', 'by_value')):
    ...     print(key)
    entries
    next_collection_link
    start
    total_size_link

However, if the total size is easy to calculate (for instance, because
all the results fit on one page), a total_size is returned instead of
total_size_link.

    >>> for key in sorted(get_collection('3.0', 'by_value', size=100)):
    ...     print(key)
    entries
    start
    total_size

    >>> pprint_collection(get_collection('3.0', 'by_value', 'no-such-value'))
    start: 0
    total_size: 0
    ---

Mutators as named operations
----------------------------

Mutator methods (methods invoked when a field is modified) are
annotated the same way as named operations, and in old versions of
lazr.restful, they were actually published as named operations.

In the example web service, mutator methods are published as named
operations in the 'beta' and '1.0' versions.

    >>> print(config.last_version_with_mutator_named_operations)
    1.0

If you look at the definition of IKeyValuePair in
lazr.restful.example.multiversion.resources, you'll see that the
'a_comment' field has two different mutators at different
times. Sometimes there is no mutator, sometimes the mutator is
'comment_mutator_1', and sometimes the mutator is
'comment_mutator_2'. Before version '2.0', mutators are published as
named operations; in version '2.0' and afterwards, they are not.

This helper method makes it easy to invoke a given mutator in a given
version.

    >>> def call_mutator(version, op="comment_mutator_1"):
    ...     url = '/pairs/foo'
    ...     entity_body = "ws.op=%s&comment=value" % op
    ...     body = webservice.post(
    ...         url, 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded', entity_body,
    ...         api_version=version)
    ...     return body

In version 'beta', the 'a_comment' field has no mutator at all.

    >>> print(call_mutator("beta"))
    HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
    ...

    >>> print(call_mutator("beta", op="comment_mutator_2"))
    HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
    ...

In version '1.0', the 'comment_mutator_1' method is the mutator for
'a_comment'. Because mutators are published as named operation in
version '1.0', we can also invoke the mutator method directly.

    >>> print(call_mutator("1.0", "comment_mutator_1"))
    HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
    ...

'comment_mutator_2' still doesn't work, because it's not the mutator
for 'a_comment' in version '1.0'.

    >>> print(call_mutator("1.0", "comment_mutator_2"))
    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    ...

Note that the response code is 400 ("Bad Request"), not 405 ("Method
Not Allowed"). 405 means that the resource publishes no named POST
operations at all. This resource does post one named POST operation
('comment_mutator_1'), so 405 isn't appropriate.

In version '2.0', the 'comment_mutator_1' method is still the mutator
for 'a_comment', but mutators are no longer published as named
operations, so we can no longer invoke the mutator method directly.

    >>> print(call_mutator("2.0"))
    HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
    ...

Note that we're back to a 405 response code. That mutator was the only
named POST operation on the key-value object, and now it's no longer
published as a named operation.

In version '3.0', the 'comment_mutator_2' method becomes the mutator
for 'a_comment'. But since version '3.0' is after version '1.0', that
method is not published as a named operation.

    >>> print(call_mutator("3.0", "comment_mutator_2"))
    HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
    ...
