def async(decorated):
  r'''Wraps a top-level function around an asynchronous dispatcher.

    when the decorated function is called, a task is submitted to a
    process pool, and a future object is returned, providing access to an
    eventual return value.

    The future object has a blocking get() method to access the task
    result: it will return immediately if the job is already done, or block
    until it completes.

    This decorator won't work on methods, due to limitations in Python's
    pickling machinery (in principle methods could be made pickleable, but
    good luck on that).
  '''
  # Keeps the original function visible from the module global namespace,
  # under a name consistent to its __name__ attribute. This is necessary for
  # the multiprocessing pickling machinery to work properly.
