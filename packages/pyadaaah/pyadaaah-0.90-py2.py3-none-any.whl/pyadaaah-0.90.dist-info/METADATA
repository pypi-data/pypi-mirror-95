Pyadaaah expands Python by an automatic, dynamic, runtime type and range checking mechanism. For example the line

vardef int exampleVar = 0 in [0..5] with rw, check(strict)

would create a 'variable' exampleVar of type integer and range 0..5. This means, that assignments alike:

exampleVar = 1.234

resp.

exampleVar = 6

would, after that, lead to a type mismatch resp. range mismatch exception. The former mechanism obviously resembles static types - as can be found in programming languages alike C and C++. Whereas the latter mechanism obviously resembles automatic range checking - as can be found in programming languages alike Ada. 

But pyadaaah goes far beyond that. Beneath type and range checking, pyadaaah e.g. also provides cython types, signals (!), semi-automatic documentation means and a python2 to python3 compatibility layer.

Pyadaaah is a pure python library (just a single '.py'-file) compatible with Python2 as well as Python3. It's license allows you to use it free of charge (please read the license text for details - it is quite short!)
