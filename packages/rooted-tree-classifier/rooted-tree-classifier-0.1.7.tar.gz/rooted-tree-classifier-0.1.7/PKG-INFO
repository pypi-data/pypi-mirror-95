        ## Description
        
        This folder contains a program that decides round complexity of homogenous LCL problems on (binary) trees.
        
        The program uses three subroutines to determines a problem's complexity.
        
        - constant_decider
            - decides whether a problem is O(1) solvable or it is inherently harder
        - log_decider
            - decides whether a problem is log(n) solvable or it is inherently harder
        - log_star_decider
            - decides whether a problem is log*(n) solvable or it is inherently harder
        
        ## Usage
        
        1. Install dependencies by `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
        
        2. Run `python -m rooted_tree_classifier` and describe (on standard input) constraints of a problem.
        For example:
        
        _Note that one needs to first run the classifier (`python -m rooted_tree_classifier`) and only afterwards provide an input
        on a separate line._
        
        ```
        python -m rooted_tree_classifier
        111
        ```
        Expected output is `O(1)`
        
        ```
        python -m rooted_tree_classifier
        112 121 122
        ```
        Expected output is `O(1)`
        
        ```
        python -m rooted_tree_classifier
        121 131 212 323
        ```
        Expected output is `O(log*n)`
        
        ```
        python -m rooted_tree_classifier
        112 121
        ```
        Expected output is `Θ(log n)`
        
        ```
        python -m rooted_tree_classifier
        112 123 131
        ```
        Expected output is `Θ(log n)`
        
        ```
        python -m rooted_tree_classifier
        121 212
        ```
        Expected output is `Ω(n)`
        ## Tests
        
        To execute tests, run the following from the root directory:
        
        ```
        python -m unittest discover
        ```
