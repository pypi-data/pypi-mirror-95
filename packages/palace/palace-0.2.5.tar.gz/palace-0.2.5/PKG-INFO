Description: # palace
        Palace is a Python 3D audio API wrapping around [alure].
        To quote alure's README,
        
        > It uses OpenAL for audio rendering, and provides common higher-level features
        > such as file loading and decoding, buffer caching, background streaming,
        > and source management for virtually unlimited sound source handles.
        
        ## Features
        In some sense, what palace aimes to be to [OpenAL Soft] is what [ModernGL]
        is to OpenGL (except that all the heavy-lifting are taken are by alure):
        
        * 3D positional sound rendering
        * Environmental effects: reverb, atmospheric air absorption,
          sound occlusion and obstruction
        * Binaural (HRTF) rendering
        * Out-of-the-box audio decoding of FLAC, MP3, Ogg Vorbis, Opus, WAV, AIFF, etc.
        * Modern Pythonic API: `snake_case`, `@property`, `with` context manager,
          type annotation
        
        ## Installation
        ### Prerequisites
        Palace requires Python 3.6+ for runtime and [pip] for installation.
        
        ### Via PyPI
        Palace can be install from the [Python Package Index][PyPI] via simply
        
            pip install palace
        
        Wheel distributions are built exclusively for GNU/Linux on amd64.
        If you want to help packaging for other platforms, please reach out
        on [our mailing list][list].
        
        ### From source
        Aside from the build dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml`, one will
        additionally need compatible Python headers, [alure], a C++14 compiler,
        [CMake] 2.6+ (and probably `git` for fetching the source).
        Palace can then be compiled and installed by running
        
            pip install git+https://git.sr.ht/~cnx/palace
        
        ## Usage
        One may start with the `examples` for sample usage of palace.
        For further information, Python's `help` is your friend and
        the API is also available for [online reference][API].
        
        ## Contributing
        Our documentation contains [a brief guide][contrib] which may help you
        get started with the development.  We also think that you might find
        [our design principles][design] appealing as well.
