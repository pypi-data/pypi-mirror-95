        Align microscopy images using custom-defined structural patterns and
        superimpose the resulting pattern distributions with data from other
        imaging modalities.

        There is no documentation yet.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        These are installation instructions for macOS, but are similar
        on other platforms.
        
        First, make sure that you have installed Python 3. Open the `Terminal` App
        and run the following command. The Python version should be printed
        to the terminal.
        
        ::
        
           python3 -V
           # Python 3.9.0
        
        The releases of impose are managed via tags. The continuous integration
        service (CI) on GitLab creates an installable Python package for each
        tag (e.g. `impose-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`). To get the latest release, browse
        to the `CI/Jobs <https://gitlab.gwdg.de/guck_optics/impose/-/jobs>`__ page.
        Find the line with the latest tag (the line that does not contain "master"
        in the "Job" column). And click on the download icon in the last column of
        that line. Unpack the "artifacts.zip" file in your "Downloads" folder.
        
        To install the Python package "impose", run the following command in the
        `Terminal` App:
        
        ::
        
            python3 -m pip install ~/Downloads/dist/impose-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
        
        This implies that the `impose-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl` file (note the version
        number in the file name, which you probably have to change) is present in the
        "dist" directory under "Downloads".
        
        
        Starting impose
        ===============
        Once you have installed impose via the method described above, you can
        start it from the `Terminal` app:
        
        ::
        
            python3 -m impose
