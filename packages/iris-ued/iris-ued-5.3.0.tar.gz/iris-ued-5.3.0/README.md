# Iris - Ultrafast Electron Scattering Data Exploration

[![Documentation Build Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/iris-ued/badge/?version=master)](http://iris-ued.readthedocs.io/) [![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/iris-ued.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/iris-ued) [![Conda-forge Version](https://img.shields.io/conda/vn/conda-forge/iris-ued.svg)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/iris-ued)


Iris is both a library for interacting with ultrafast electron
diffraction data, as well as a GUI frontend for interactively exploring
this data.

Iris also includes a plug-in manager so that you can explore your data.

## Installation

To interact with `iris` datasets from a Python environment, the `iris` package must be installed. `iris` is available on PyPI; it can be installed with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io).:

    python -m pip install iris-ued

`iris` is also available on the conda-forge channel:

    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda install iris-ued

To install the latest development version from
[Github](https://github.com/LaurentRDC/iris-ued):

    python -m pip install git+git://github.com/LaurentRDC/iris-ued.git

Each version is tested against Python 3.7+. If you are using a different
version, tests can be run using the `pytest` package.

### Windows Installers

For Windows, installers are available on the [Releases](https://github.com/LaurentRDC/iris-ued/releases) page. You will still need to install `iris` via `pip` or `conda` to use the scripting functionality.

## Usage

Once installed, the package can be imported as `iris`.

The GUI component can be launched from a command line interpreter as
`python -m iris` or `pythonw -m iris` (no console window). See the documentation
for a visual guide.

## Documentation

The [Documentation on readthedocs.io](https://iris-ued.readthedocs.io)
provides API-level documentation, as well as tutorials.
